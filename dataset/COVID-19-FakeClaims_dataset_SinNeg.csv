1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,The mechanism through which temperature may execute its mitigative effects remains unclear though it has already been posited that increased vitamin D levels due to greater sun exposure may result in better immune response against the SARS CoV 2 virus as it has been shown to do within the context of other viruses 42 43 Notably when temperature is substituted out of our final model for other vitamin D proxies such as average daily sunlight and latitude above and below 37 degrees the results are also highly significant in the same direction Including these variables together in the model resulted in multicollinearity which suggests that they are most likely measuring the same effect Thus in this study average temperature prior to the first reported COVID 19 case was chosen to be the vitamin D proxy because it was the continuous variable that contained the most specific and validated data at the county level,
1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,the signal and value of the coefficients of regressors are of utterly importance to understand how the spread of COVID 19 is expected to be affected by temperature and humidity According to all models temperature increases the doubling time which means that it delays the spread of COVID 19 Humidity on the contrary benefits it The models differ however on the amount of contribution: for example in the best scenario  the doubling time is increased by 0090 days for each Celsius degree increase and is increased by 0072 days for each unit decrease of the humidity value,
1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,No significant association between COVID 19 incidence and absolute humidity was observed in distributed lag nonlinear models Additionally A modified susceptible exposed infectious recovered model confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale Temperature is an environmental driver of the COVID 19 outbreak in China Lower and higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID 19 incidence,
1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,Considering that influenza virus and mumps virus are all lipid enveloped the conclusion of this laboratory investigation may explain our finding in some degree It supports our result that low temperature has more adverse effect than high temperature In terms of relative humidity the lab results were different from ours This could be due to they only assessed the influence of relative humidity at a constant temperature of 20 C while the temperature in our study ranging from 156 C to 29 C,
1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,weather alone increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions Further studies on the effects of absolute humidity and temperature on COVID 19 transmission are needed,
1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,Our study has some implications First the nonlinear relationship between ambient temperature and COVID 19 confirmed cases showed COVID 19 may not perish of itself without any public health interventions when the weather becomes warmer So the public and governments could not expect the high temperature to eradicate this novel virus Additionally increasing temperature in regions or periods below 3Â°C is related to the high risk of transmission which provides useful information for policymakers if the novel coronavirus coexists with human for a long time,
1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,In the first season of 2020 an outbreak of atypical pneumonia COVID 19 caused by a novel coronavirus 1 has spread all over the world and had a great impact on public health and worldwide economy This new virus has some relations to SARS CoV but it is more aggressive than SARS MERS or the seasonal influenza 2 It has exhibited relatively high human to human transmissibility compared to other coronavirus infections 3 To predict epidemic trend meteorological conditions are suggested to be an important factor as well as population mobility and human to human contact These meteorological factors such as humidity visibility and wind speed can affect droplet stability in the environment or affect survival of viruses as air temperature does and thus impact epidemic transmission Air temperature and absolute humidity have been indicated to significantly influence the transmission of COVID 19 However there are only five studies published on preprint hubs discussed the involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of COVID 19 up to now and they all focused on data from China without model validation or prediction,
1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,Previous studies have showed that temperature is also an important factor in the survival and transmission of other coronaviruses like SARS CoV and MERS CoV so we compared our main findings with results in these studies found that the optimum environmental temperature related to SARS cases was from 16C to 28C Moreover reported that temperature had a negative relationship with SARS transmission in Hong Kong and Beijing in 2003 A laboratory study using surrogate viruses to investigate the effect of temperature on coronavirus survival on surfaces showed that viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 20 C than at 4C Another laboratory study found that coronavirus on smooth surfaces was stable for over 5 days when temperature at 22 C 25 C and virus viability was rapidly lost at higher temperatures observed that MERS CoV was less stable at high temperature In brief most studies showed that there was an optimum temperature for coronavirus and high temperature was harmful to its viability However this paper could not observe a negative effect of high temperature on COVID 19 infection A possible reason may be that the study period was limited in winter with maximal mean temperature 269C,
1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,Several studies predicted that high temperature and humidity could reduce COVID 19 transmission However exceptions exist to this observation further thorough examinations are thus needed for their confirmation In this study therefore we used a global dataset of COVID 19 cases and global climate databases and comprehensively investigated how climate parameters could contribute to the growth rate of COVID 19 cases while statistically controlling for potential confounding effects using spatial analysis We also confirmed that the growth rate decreased with the temperature; however the growth rate was affected by precipitation seasonality and warming velocity rather than temperature In particular a lower growth rate was observed for a higher precipitation seasonality and lower warming velocity These effects were independent of population density human life quality and travel restrictions The results indicate that the temperature effect is less important compared to these intrinsic climate characteristics which might thus be useful for explaining the exceptions However the contributions of the climate parameters to the growth rate were moderate; rather the contribution of travel restrictions in each country was more significant Although our findings are preliminary owing to data analysis limitations they may be helpful when predicting COVID 19 transmission,
1,high temperatures and sun can reduce covid transmission,High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract like influenza and of SARS coronavirus The main reasons are the virus is more stable in cold temperatures and respiratory droplets as containers of viruses remain in suspension longer in dry air  Cold and dry weather can also demote the hosts immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus Many respiratory pathogens show seasonality and the human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors limited during the COVID 19 outbreak due to the absence of extreme climatic conditions and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus Cold air temperature contributes to spread of viruses including coronavirus and the possibility of infection Some possible reasons are: low temperature provides suitable survival and reproduction conditions for coronavirus cold air causes vasoconstriction of the respiratory tract which contributes to weakening of the immune system; and dry cold air makes the nasal mucosa prone to small ruptures thereby creating opportunities for virus invasion,

0,covid can not be cured,SARS CoV 2 the virus which causes COVID 19 is classified as a HG3 hazard group 3 pathogen such as HIV and TB In some infected people it may cause a severe and acute respiratory syndrome which can be fatal There is presently still no vaccine or effective cure for COVID 19 infection and treatment is symptomatic,
0,covid can not be cured,Moreover the HCoV 19 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome like the critically severe case here However the cure of COVID 2019 is essentially dependent on the patient's own immune system When the overactivated immune system kills the virus it produces a large number of inflammatory factors leading to the severe cytokine storms It suggests that the main reason of these organs damage may be due to virus induced cytokine storm Older subjects may be much easier to be affected due to immunosenescence,
0,covid can not be cured,Still we lack with any proper treatment or vaccines as a cure for this disease Hence to control its transmission further isolating the infected individuals in special quarantine cells has been implemented in most of the countries Despite of these prevention strategies we are in danger as the transmission is still ongoing and the mortality due to the virus maintains a high level,

1,best way to diagnose covid is a laboratory test,The gold standard for covid 19 testing is the polymerase chain reaction test In a PCR test genetic material collected in a nasal swab is copied millions or billions of times over so that markers for covid 19 infection can be identified the virus RNA is too tiny to identify on its own but making more copies makes it easier to find PCR testing isnât perfect but itâs seen as the most accurate form of testing available for viruses Unfortunately it takes time energy and trained personnel to run these tests That makes PCR testing too hard to scale up to the numbers we really need,
1,best way to diagnose covid is a laboratory test,An antigen test on the other hand can deliver results on the spot That means its suitable for frequent follow up testing You could use it in cases where you need a quick yes or no result like in an overwhelmed hospital at a nursing home where patients are not mobile enough to go to a testing site or to determine whether health care workers have been infected,
1,best way to diagnose covid is a laboratory test,According to the latest guidelines published by the Chinese government the diagnosis of COVID 19 must be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR or gene sequencing for respiratory or blood specimens as the key indicator for hospitalization However with limitations of sample collection and transportation as well as kit performance the total positive rate of RT PCR for throat swab samples has been reported to be about 30% to 60% at initial presentation,

1,best way to diagnose covid is a laboratory test,Serological tests measure the amount of antibodies or proteins present in the blood when the body is responding to a specific infection like COVID 19 In other words the test detects the bodys immune response to the infection caused by the virus rather than detecting the virus itself In the early days of an infection when the bodys immune response is still building antibodies may not be detected This limits the tests effectiveness for diagnosing COVID 19 and why it should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose COVID 19,
1,best way to diagnose covid is a laboratory test,Serological tests can play a critical role in the fight against COVID 19 by helping healthcare professionals to identify individuals who have overcome an infection in the past and have developed an immune response In the future this may potentially be used to help determine together with other clinical data that such individuals are no longer susceptible to infection and can return to work In addition these test results can aid in determining who may donate a part of their blood called convalescent plasma which may serve as a possible treatment for those who are seriously ill from COVID 19 This is why Vice President Mike Pence called on the laboratory community to develop serological tests for COVID 19,
0,drink alcohol protects against COVID,Koob starkly reminded us that drinking is contraindicated for catching the coronavirus because it lowers the immune response Alcohol interacts with many conditions The silver lining is that this allows people to evaluate their relationship with alcohol said Koob of the Pennsylvania policy Everybodys going to have a dry March whether they like it or not he said Hopefully we wont lose too many people to alcohol withdrawal This will be a triage situation If the projected viral spread goes on to be the worstâcase scenario its going to be a very crowded emergency room,

0,vaccines against pneumonia provide protection against the new coronavirus,,
1,vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health,Respiratory tract viruses are particularly significant causes of illness and death in children and in the elderly Vaccines offer the possibility of decreasing the severity and complications of viral respiratory disease but development has been delayed by numerous factors First there are more than 200 serologically distinct RNA and DNA virus species and strains which cause an essentially similar spectrum of disease Some re infect at high efficiency despite little antigenic variation while others exhibit extensive coat protein variability Vaccine candidates show variable efficacy in partially immune adults the immunocompromised and the elderly and may be ineffective or pathogenic in neonates or in the presence of maternal antibodies However effective childhood vaccines are essential to prevent severe disease due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza and to reduce virus transmission to adults,
1,vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health,Respiratory viral infections are one of the next group of diseases likely to be targeted for prevention in childhood by the use of vaccines The patient and family met 87 per cent of total costs The lowest average cost occurred in households from the highest income bracket Acute respiratory illness managed in the community is common with the responsibility for meeting the cost of episodes predominantly borne by the patient and family in the form of lost productivity These findings have implications for preventive strategies in children such as the individual use of or implementation of public programs using currently available vaccines against influenza and vaccines under development against other viral respiratory pathogens,
1,vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health,Over the past 15 years several vaccine manufacturers have developed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in which a number of S pneumoniae PS are covalently coupled to a protein carrier Conjugate vaccines elicit higher antibody levels and a more efficient immune response in infants young children and immunodeficient persons than the PS vaccines as well as a significant immunological memory resulting in a booster antibody response on subsequent exposure to the antigen Moreover these vaccines suppress nasopharyngeal carriage of the pathogen and reduce bacterial transmission in the community leading to herd immunity which adds considerable value to their implementation Conjugate vaccines immunization followed by PS vaccine boosting might provide a foundation for life-long protection against pneumococcal disease,10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.07.046
1,vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health,Influenza virus causes substantial burden of illness in all age groups during regular epidemics and occasional pandemics Children often face the highest risk of infections during epidemics because of higher levels of person-to-person contact and therefore greater exposure as well as lower immunity due to fewer previous infections Influenza vaccination is effective in reducing the risk of influenza virus infection and illness,10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.07.084
1,vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health,Influenza vaccine which has been available for half a century has proved effective in preventing hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza during outbreaks of influenza types A and B The antiviral agents amantadine and rimantadine provide approximately equivalent and signillcant efficacy in protection against clinical illness resulting from influenza type A only However the potential for side effects is more marked with amantadine,10.1016/s0002-9343(99)80307-6

0,eating garlic can help prevent infection with the new coronavirus,This Cochrane review looked at the effect of garlic on the prevention and treatment of the common cold Only one trial met the inclusion criteria and found insufficient evidence to recommend garlic supplements as a preventative or treatment option for the common cold The small trial suggests that garlic might reduce the frequency of symptoms of the common cold if taken continuously as a daily prophylactic but the results require validation Anecdotally adverse events reported include odour and minor skin or respiratory irritation but the frequency of adverse effects could not be determined from the evidence available,10.1038/sj.ebd.6400674
0,eating garlic can help prevent infection with the new coronavirus,Only one trial met the inclusion criteria therefore limited conclusions can be drawn The trial relied on self reported episodes of the common cold but was of reasonable quality in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment Adverse effects included rash and odour Authors conclusions There is insufficient clinical trial evidence regarding the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold A single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold but more studies are needed to validate this finding Claims of effectiveness appear to rely largely on poor-quality evidence,10.1002/14651858.cd006206.pub4
0,eating garlic can help prevent infection with the new coronavirus,Garlic cloves have been used traditionally to treat a number of infectious diseases However only few confirmatory studies have been published regarding the traditional antiviral uses The clinical effectiveness of garlic on the prevention of common cold was investigated by Josling in 2005 who published a double blind placebo controlled study assessing 146 patients more than a 12 week treatment period with an allicin containing garlic supplement,10.1002/med.20176

0,the new coronavirus only affects older people,It must be a difficult and frightening time for many older people indeed for all of us young and old There is a widespread perception in the community that the impact of COVID 19 is confined only to older people with underlying illnesses This is not correct severe infection and significant mortality occur across the life course although the risks for older people are very high However we need to be cautious about the narrative linking this pandemic to older people The Reframing Aging Initiative is particularly relevant for understanding the importance of inclusive language when communicating about COVID 19,10.1093/gerona/glaa077
0,the new coronavirus only affects older people,We find a clear picture of how social distancing varies with age Older people seem just as likely as younger people to go out of their homes However the expected number of close contacts with non household members falls rapidly with age Holding other factors constant people over 50 years of age have less than half the expected number of close contacts than people age 18 29 This age gradient is in line with the WHO and CDC recommendations that older people should take special precautions because they are more likely to develop a severe illness if they contract COVID 19 However older adults in the United States tend to have smaller social networks compared with younger adults which could also contribute to the phenomenon we are observing here,10.1101/2020.04.19.20065219
0,the new coronavirus only affects older people,To conclude COVID 19 can affect all age group irrespective of whether the individual is young or old Therefore the statement by World Health Organization Older people are at highest risk from COVID 19 is still conflicting Therefore in depth research is required before making such claims as this may piles up the mental pressure to individuals There have been cases whether people believed to be suffering from COVID 19 committing suicide in India Bangladesh frontline medical doctor from New York and German finance minister Thomas Schafer As of now it would be more apt to state that People with chronic health conditions are at highest risk from COVID 19 as strong immunity is the key weapon to fight against Covid 19,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109896
0,the new coronavirus only affects older people,It has been reported that the expression of ACE2 reduces with the increasing age Since young patients possess high levels of ACE2 they are more prone to COVID 19 infection Whereas in old age people other than reduced ACE2 levels other co morbid conditions such as cardiovascular problems diabetes and hypertension might be present The medication prescribed for these patients helps in elevating the ACE2 levels which might enhance the viral entry Though the treatment reduces the co morbid severities the viral infection is enhanced in those patients Therefore it is conclusive that young patients even though they are more susceptible to the COVID 19 infection they are less severely affected and exhibit elevated angiotensin II signaling Whereas the older patients who exhibit low levels of ACE2 and higher angiotensin II signaling leads to hypertension The usage of ACEi and ARBs help in promoting the vasodilatory effects by elevating the ACE2 levels thereby becoming susceptible to COVID 19 infection and are severely affected,10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117839
0,the new coronavirus only affects older people,However more and more young people have been diagnosed along with the pandemic progression of the disease and the development of rapid COVID 19 testing techniques Currently we know that young people also can be seriously affected by SARS CoV 2,10.1097/jcma.0000000000000323
0,the new coronavirus only affects older people,The number of COVID 19 cases in the age group under 20 years was relatively small However people aged 20 29 years were one of the most affected age groups which indicates that preventive measures against the new coronavirus should also target young adults While deaths were most common in the elderly asymptomatic young people or those with very mild symptoms may have spread the infection to their relatives especially parents and grandparents,10.12659/msm.924702
0,the new coronavirus only affects older people,A valid question is why some COVID 19 positive test cases present with only mild symptoms compared to others that have severe symptomatology ending up with fatal outcomes So far all data indicates that people who are older immunocompromised or have significant underlying conditions such as heart failure coronary heart disease arrhythmia diabetic nephropathy and mainly any kind of limited lung function asthma acute or chronic pulmonary disease among others are more likely to develop poorer outcomes and multiorgan failure However it is unclear why COVID 19 has caused the death of perhaps thousands of young and not so young people without any apparent underlying health conditions Scientists are desperately trying to unravel why COVID 19 can be lethal to young and apparently healthy individuals,10.3390/pathogens9050389
0,the new coronavirus only affects older people,This virus also has arisen various hypotheses among scientists who are eager to demonstrate novel disease mechanism According to one hypothesis proposed by Jean Laurent Casanova of Rockefeller University immunosenescence contributes at least in part to the severe disease and high mortality of the elderly However equally important is to explain the fatal disease occasionally observed in the young population For example there may be an underlying inborn error of immunity associated with severe COVID 19 that affects younger individuals,10.1186/s12967-020-02364-2
0,the new coronavirus only affects older people,Multiple reports have demonstrated that children and young adults have a milder form of the disease compared to adults  Asymptomatic mild and moderate infections comprise over 90% of all children who have tested positive for COVID 19 with fewer severe and critical cases compared to adults  The possible reasons for lower number and milder infections in children and young adults include lower exposure to virions being isolated at home and minimal exposure to pollution and cigarette smoke contributing to healthier respiratory tracts The elderly may be susceptible to severe COVID 19 disease by their qualitatively different immune response encompassed by the terms immunosenescence and inflammaging  Viral co infection may be important in potentially leading to limited replication of the SARS CoV 2 by direct virus to virus interaction and competition  Additionally the distribution maturation and functioning of viral receptors such as ACE2 may be important in age dependent susceptibility to severe COVID 19,10.1007/s13312-020-1819-5
1,Older people and with pre existing conditions more vulnerable virus,Age adjusted all cause mortality is known to be higher in men than in women and as a result women live longer than men In the case of COVID 19 this trend seems to be even stronger For example across most age groups men are twice more likely to die from COVID 19 than women in Italy  with the exception of one age group  90 years old and older However the population age structure may explain the higher mortality in oldest women Pre existing conditions substantially increase the risk of death from COVID 19 These are primarily age related diseases ie hypertension type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases This risk is even higher in patients with multiple comorbidities Overall it further supports the notion that COVID 19 is an agerelated disease,10.1101/2020.04.15.20060095

0,antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus,Interestingly both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence Similarly two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID 19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin both drugs with significant senolytic activity Also Chloroquine related compounds inhibit the induction of the well known senescence marker Beta galactosidase Other anti aging drugs should also be considered such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis blocking both SASP and viral replication Therefore we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID 19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus as well as aid in its treatment Thus we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted as several senolytic and anti aging therapeutics are existing FDA approved drugs with excellent safety profiles and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL 6 production we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side effect for the treatment and prevention of COVID 19 disease,10.18632/aging.103001
0,antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus,Antibiotics have been prescribed to COVID 19 patients with low immune function namely the elderly and medically fragile patients The administration of antibiotics prevents bacterial co infections whilst strengthening the immune support leading to better chance of recovery Antibiotic treatments have demonstrated positive therapeutic outcomes in various clinical studies Specifically cephalosporins carbapenems and quinolones are antibiotics that have been given to COVID 19 patients either in single or multi antibiotic treatment in parallel with antiviral agents The epidemiological study reported that the combined treatment has seen some success in treating COVID 19 with patients reportedly recovering and then being discharged from hospitals,10.3390/ijerph17072323
1,COVID pacients may receive antibiotics bacterial coinfection is possible,Bacterial and viral coinfection is increasingly recognized as an underlying etiology for community- and hospital-acquired infections Coinfections may be a risk factor for ICU admission severity of disease and mortality Clinicians must be aware of these coinfections for appropriate management and prognostication as well as for the prevention of nosocomial spread of viral illness,10.1097/mcc.0000000000000435
1,COVID pacients may receive antibiotics bacterial coinfection is possible,Furthermore with fears surrounding prolonged patient contact and aerosol generation the number of patients undergoing routine microbiological investigation may be reduced One potential solution to support antimicrobial prescribing in COVID 19 is the use of bacterial specific biomarkers such as procalcitonin Procalcitonin has been demonstrated to support differentiation between bacterial and viral infection and supports early cessation of antibiotics in confirmed bacterial infection with no effect on patient mortality Procalcitonin use has been reported in the COVID 19 literature and may be an important tool to support reducing antimicrobial  use Furthermore the use of clinical decision support systems may facilitate better use of data in supporting decision making especially when linked with artificial intelligence In addition infection specialties who are normally responsible for co ordinating stewardship programs must continue to provide support to clinical teams managing COVID 19 patients to ensure that regular review and cessation of antimicrobial therapy is considered based on the limited clinical evidence available within these patients Supporting appropriate microbiological sampling prior to commencement of antimicrobial therapy should also be encouraged within this patient cohort to ensure that the clinician has as much data as possible to support decision making,10.1093/cid/ciaa530
1,COVID pacients may receive antibiotics bacterial coinfection is possible,There is no direct evidence to support the efficacy of antibiotic agents in children with COVID 19 A high proportion of patients with COVID 19 were treated with antibiotics despite the lack of etiological evidence Current evidence suggests that secondary bacterial infections such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae may occur in COVID 19 patients and antibiotic agents are widely used in the clinical treatment of COVID 19 For SARS evidence suggests that early use of antibiotics has no effect on the clinical outcomes but the use of broad spectrum antibiotics increased the risk of dysbacteriosis which can cause nosocomial infections However when bacterial infections are identified rational use of antibiotic agents showed valid results in relieving symptoms and reducing the leukocyte count,10.1101/2020.04.13.20064402
1,COVID pacients may receive antibiotics bacterial coinfection is possible,Experimental therapies for the treatment of SARS COV 2 are being explored for example hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin Antimicrobial therapy has a role in the treatment of suspected or confirmed bacterial or fungal bacterial fungal respiratory co infection This may be empiric or targeted in patients presenting to hospital or for the management of nosocomial infection acquired during admission to hospital such as hospital acquired pneumonia or ventilator associated pneumonia,10.1093/cid/ciaa530
1,COVID pacients may receive antibiotics bacterial coinfection is possible,Despite frequent prescription of broad spectrum empirical antimicrobials in patients with coronavirus associated respiratory infections there is a paucity of data to support the association with respiratory bacterial fungal co infection Generation of prospective evidence to support development of antimicrobial policy and appropriate stewardship interventions specific for the COVID 19 pandemic are urgently required,10.1093/cid/ciaa530
1,COVID pacients may receive antibiotics bacterial coinfection is possible,Some national guidelines and cases series have suggested the use of broadspectrum antibiotics or the benefit of atypical antibiotic cover. It is anticipated that during the epidemic an increased number of patients will require commencement on empirical antimicrobial therapy. Therefore it is important that antimicrobial stewardship programs focus on supporting the optimal selection of empirical therapies and the rapid de escalation of treatment once SARS COV 2 infection is confirmed. Given the suggested use of broad spectrum agents and macrolides this is important to prevent unintended consequences of antimicrobial therapy including toxicity such as QT prolongation antibiotic associated diarrhoea and the propagation of antimicrobial resistance through increased usage of antimicrobials within healthcare systems. We performed a review of the medical literature to explore commonly reported bacterial fungal co infections in patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus lower respiratory tract infections. Given the lack of data surrounding SARS COV 2 we also opted to include other coronavirus infections. Whilst acknowledging that evidence may differ between coronavirus infections we wanted to explore whether similar observations have been made between these infections. We opted to include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS 1 Middle Eastern Respiratory,10.1093/cid/ciaa530
0,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,Because most microbes potentially attached to the masks can be decontaminated within minutes through steaming on boiling water and the blocking efficacy of MMs and N95Ms decline little even after they have been steamed for two hours we presume that MMs and N95Ms can be used for up to seven to ten days if they keep clean and fitted and have not been damaged by other factors Therefore this study is valuable for solving the great shortage of masks in many countries for fighting the COVID 19 pandemic It can also minimize unnecessary waste and protect the environment for discarding reusable masks,10.1002/jmv.25921
0,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,The COVID 19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 has claimed many lives worldwide Wearing medical masks or N95 masks namely N95 respirators can slow the virus spread and reduce the infection risk Reuse of these masks can minimize waste protect the environment and help to solve the current imminent shortage of masks Disinfection of used masks is needed for reuse of them with safety but improper decontamination can damage the blocking structure of masks In this study we demonstrated using avian coronavirus of infectious bronchitis virus to mimic SARS CoV 2 that medical masks and N95 masks remained their blocking efficacy after being steamed on boiling water even for 2 hours We also demonstrated that three brands of medical masks blocked over 99% viruses in aerosols The avian coronavirus was completely inactivated after being steamed for 5 minutes Together this study suggested that medical masks are adequate for use on most social occasions and both medical masks and N95 masks can be reused for a few days with steam decontamination between use,10.1002/jmv.25921
0,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,In this study we investigated the effect of different decontamination methods on disposable N95 masks for virucidal effect on SARS CoV 2 and on N95 mask integrity In order to be compatible with reuse methods of N95 mask SARS CoV 2 decontamination must remove the viral threat be harmless to the mask user and not compromise the integrity of the various mask elements The decontamination methods utilized 70% ethanol ultraviolet light and vaporized hydrogen peroxide have previously been demonstrated to be safe for mask users  We found that any ethanol exposure significantly altered mask integrity as previously reported  We also found that the impact of 70% ethanol on mask integrity appears time dependent In fact thirty minutes after 70% ethanol application there was even a larger decline in function even though the N95 masks feel dry to the touch Consistent with prior studies we did observe a decline in SARS CoV 2 infectivity (as assessed by Vero E6 culture) after certain decontamination strategies,10.1101/2020.04.11.20062331
0,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,In order for an N95 mask to be reused more safely the mask should be decontaminated of SARS CoV 2 while maintaining its filtration efficiency and fit factor Currently limited information is known about SARS CoV 2 inactivation The addition of moisture possibly plays a role in the inactivation of some viruses A study found viral inactivation in 70 o C for 5 minutes while in a buffered solution SARS CoV 2 has also been shown to be inactivated at temperatures of 60 75 o C for 5 30 minutes in various liquid media Other enveloped viruses such as H1N1 and H5N1 Influenza strains have been shown to be inactivated with moist heat at 65 C and over 50% humidity These studies also found that dry heat alone was not enough to deactivate H1N1 While previous studies have looked at the effects of moist heat on N95 FFRs these were done at substantially lower temperatures of 60 65 C We also note that recent CDC guidelines have indicated that moist heat is a reasonable method for reusing N95 FFRs The resistance of Clostridium difficile  at elevated temperature and moisture was also studied and found temperatures,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059758
0,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,The results of our experiences and experiments indicate that our sterilization process did not influence the functionality of the masks tested In case of an acute shortage of FFP2 masks steam sterilization eg in laminate sterilization wrappings of used masks at 121 â°C in laminated bags is a simple useful cost-effective and quick procedure that can be used to make used masks available for safe reuse The sterilization process of available standard autoclaves in hospitals may have to be adjusted in order to use this sterilization method We also emphasise that we performed these experiments with 3M masks only However our method seems to be a potentially useful way to reuse mouth masks other hospitals facing a shortage of masks may wish to test and validate this approach to reusing masks,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.04.001
1,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,sterilizing the used respirator only reusing it for a limited time and proper disposal of the used masks have been recommended Although respirators the protective classes are produced as single use items they could be used again for a limited time unless there is a risk for contamination through the deposition of infectious particles on the surface When the respirator becomes soiled or wet with bodily fluids or it can no longer be appropriately fitted or if breathing via the respirator becomes difficult it should be discarded Also masks should be discarded after being used during an aerosol generating procedure Until now manufacturers have had no reason to disinfect masks or to produce masks for repeated use However there is a vital need to be able to disinfect masks and reuse them SARS CoV 2 remains viable in the environment including on the surface of different materials like cardboard iron or tissue for some time This suggests that there is a risk for rapid contamination of the outer surface of respirators and surgical masks Contamination of the respirator surface could be prevented through placing a medical mask over it or wearing a face shield that can be cleaned,10.1016/j.cca.2020.05.044
0,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,reuse masks involving donning and doffing of masks multiple times Some recommendations exist for extended or limited reuse of FFRs during pandemics for certain types of respiratory viruses but not others One of the principle concerns with abandoning disposal of respiratory masks is the potential for the masks to become contaminated with fluids that may affect respirator performance as well as the potential for the masks to act as reservoirs of infectious microorganisms While the risk of re aerosolization of viable viral particles from contaminated FFRs has been assessed as low virus contaminated N95 FFRs may also act as a source of hand contamination Decontamination of masks to facilitate safe re use has been postulated as one albeit controversial solution with a number of studies over the last 20 years investigating the effectiveness of different decontamination methods on the performance of the treated FFR in protecting the HCW and or removing the potential of the FFR to act as a fomite It has been suggested that for N95 FFR decontamination to be considered successful the method must remove the presence of the infectious agent not harm the user and not compromise the function of the respirator itself,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.05.032
0,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,course they would there unto have to be decontaminated after each use This procedure is not at all ubiquitous in the medical system as FFRs are intended for single use by manufacturers However in recent years the scientific literature has laid out various possibilities to decontaminate FFRs and reuse them several times All these methods must meet the following requirements the masks must be decontaminated the effectiveness of the mask must not be damaged the user must not be endangered in any other way and the masks should be ready for reuse quickly In addition the methods should avoid the usage of disinfectants as these are in short supply in the current situation It is worth noting that wearing masks cannot replace the important roles of social distancing and hand hygiene and donning and doffing of masks should be conducted correctly Otherwise their blocking efficacy might decline greatly and infection risk might increase greatly If a doffed mask will be reused it should be doffed without touching its surface and the doffed mask should be put directly into a plastic bag or stainless steel box for steam and avoiding contamination of the surface of other items Then hands should be washed immediately,10.1002/jmv.25921
0,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,As the current COVID 19 pandemic illustrates not all hospitals and other facilities are equipped with enough personal protective equipment to meet the demand in a crisis Healthcare workers around the world utilize N95 masks to protect themselves and their patients yet during this global pandemic they are forced to re wear what is intended to be single use masks This poses significant risk to these healthcare workers along with the populations they are trying to protect Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation has been validated previously as a way to effectively sterilize these masks between use however not all facilities have access to the high cost commercial UV C lamp sterilization equipment However UV C bulbs are sitting idle in biosafety cabinets at universities and research facilities around the globe that have been shuttered to slow the spread of COVID 19,
1,Replace mask when it is damp do not reuse,Various measures including washing boiling baking sunlight exposure hair dryer blowing autoclave alcohol treatment active chlorine treatment ozone treatment ethylene oxide treatment gamma irradiation or ultraviolet irradiation have been recommended to decontaminate masks for reuse Some of them can damage the blocking structure of MMs or N95Ms through physical or chemical action and some of them may inactivate pathogens incompletely and some of them are unsuitable to common people because they require specific instruments or materials,10.1002/jmv.25921
0,healthy person only need to wear a mask if he is taking care of a person with COVID 19,The World Health Organization WHO declared COVID 19 the disease caused by SARS CoV 2 a pandemic The SARS CoV 2 virus is spread through inoculation of mucous membranes by droplets and aerosols containing the virus  as well as contact with droplet contaminated fomites  The world health organisation WHO on April 2020 has issued guidance on Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease COVID 19 and considerations during severe shortages The WHO has recommended that when dealing with patients on a suspected COVID 19 positive patient must wear an N95 or FFP2 mask There is also a recommendation that a medical mask gown gloves and eye protection goggles or face shield is sufficient The WHO also recommends that other staff on a ward not providing direct care require no PPE,10.1101/2020.06.08.20125708

1,wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing,Wearing a mask has a significant impact on the spread of cough ejecta We observe the time dependent trajectories of large and small droplets with time from the respiratory event Thus large droplets are trapped by the mask while the damping of the turbulent flow field by the mask leads to smaller droplets being transported only over relatively short distances Flow through the openings around the mask convects small droplets along the face in contrast to the case without a mask We estimate the potential viral concentrations suspended in the air and deposited on the floor due to propagation of droplets from the respiratory event of an infected person,
1,wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing,Toxicology demonstrates that human beings differ in sensitivities to every virus and the response spectrum follows a normal distribution All these issues are out of the scope of this study Present modeling proves pollution created by sneezing may cause cross infection indoors The traditional courtesy of covering your mouth with a handkerchief when sneezing may also have its merit in reducing infection In regard to the control strategies good personal hygiene habits such as wearing a mask and personalized air supply are important Further studies on their effects on preventing the transmission of respiratory diseases are needed,10.1016/j.buildenv.2005.05.014
1,wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing,Simple surgical and N95 masks are probably effective to a certain extent either in preventing the noninfected wearer eg health care workers from inhaling influenza containing droplets from either a close or more distant source or in containing the infectious exhaled air from an infected wearer eg patients The problem with wearing masks for either purpose tends to mainly be that of maintaining an effective mask position on the face for long periods of time45 Sweating and contact irritation can combine to cause mask displacement or removal noncompliance It may be particularly difficult when patients suffering from coughing or sneezing are made to wear masks to contain their infection as a form of infection control,10.1016/j.idc.2010.04.001

0,coronaviruses may not persist on surfaces more than pair seconds,a survey of a hospital room with a quarantined COVID 19 patient demonstrated extensive environmental contamination Knowledge of the transmission dynamics of COVID 19 is currently developing but based upon studies of SARS and MERS CoV preliminary data on SARS CoV 2 it seems likely that SARS CoV 2 can potentially persist on fomites ranging from a couple of hours to 5 days depending on the material Based upon preliminary studies of SARS CoV 2 survival the virus survives longest at a relative humidity of 40% on plastic surfaces and shortest in aerosol form however survival in aerosol was determined at a relative humidity of 65%  we predict that the viability of SARS CoV 2 in aerosol is likely longer at lower relative humidity levels There is preliminary data demonstrating the presence of SARS CoV 2 in stool indicating that transmission can potentially occur through the fecal oral pathway While transmission of COVID 19 has been documented only through respiratory droplet spread and not through deposition on fomites steps should still be taken to clean and disinfect all potential sources of SARS CoV 2 under the assumption that active virus may be transmitted by contact with these abiotic surfaces,10.1128/msystems.00245-20
0,coronaviruses may not persist on surfaces more than pair seconds,The role of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in propagating disease is unclear Many initial COVID 19 cases were linked to this market suggesting that SARS CoV 2 was transmitted from animals to humans However a genomic study has provided evidence that the virus was introduced from another yet unknown location into the market where it spread more rapidly although human to human transmission may have occurred earlier Clusters of infected family members and medical workers have confirmed the presence of person to person transmission After January 1 less than 10% of patients had market exposure and more than 70% patients had no exposure to the market Person to person transmission is thought to occur among close contacts mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes Fomites may be a large source of transmission as SARS CoV has been found to persist on surfaces up to 96 h and other coronaviruses for up to 9 days,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.019
0,coronaviruses may not persist on surfaces more than pair seconds,Rigorous hand hygiene and surfaces in the dental office is the most important measure of reducing the transmission of microorganisms to patients Depending on surface type temperature humidity SARS CoV 2 may persist on surfaces from a few hours to a few days All reading materials magazines and toys should be removed from the dental office,10.1016/j.jds.2020.04.012
0,coronaviruses may not persist on surfaces more than pair seconds,Human to human transmission of SARS CoV 2 occurs by close contact in particular through respiratory droplets This modality of transmission does not apply to a postmortem procedure However albeit less frequently it is postulated that transmission may occur via the contamination of inanimate surfaces from activated virus Even if there exists not much evidence when dealing with COVID 19 studies on related viruses such as MERS and SARS demonstrated persistence until 9 days on metallic glassy or plastic surfaces Nonetheless complete inactivation could be achieved by disinfection with 62â71% ethanol hydrogen peroxide and 1% sodium hypochlorite Application of UV radiation for 60 min also seems to result in complete inactivation of viral infectivity,10.1007/s00428-020-02861-1

0,coronaviruses may not persist on surfaces more than pair seconds,Studies have shown that viruses adsorbed on surfaces can maintain high rates of survival and infection potential Exactly how long viruses retain their viability on a surface is highly variable and dependent on surface porosity environmental factors and virus envelope characteristics First nonporous surfaces compared with porous surfaces are more effective in receiving and transferring viruses and are typically better at preserving virus viability because they do not draw moisture away from adsorbed viruses However if a porous material is inoculated it is capable of harboring most strains of viruses especially at low temperatures eg 4 and can remain contagious despite the lower rates of transfer to skin SARS CoV 2 has demonstrated an ability to contaminate a wide range of porous and nonporous fomites To our knowledge no studies have evaluated the persistence of SARS CoV 1 or SARS CoV 2 on skin,
0,coronaviruses may not persist on surfaces more than pair seconds,After the first outbreak of COVID 19 in Wuhan China it was determined that the main transmission route of this novel coronavirus was through inhalation of respiratory droplets released from an infected person coughing and sneezing and/or having direct contact with a contaminated surface A lot of attention has been placed on personal protection measures whilst practicing respiratory hygiene observing coughing etiquette wearing a mask frequent hand washing However reports on the transmission of SARS CoV 2 to humans from contaminated surfaces are rare Some studies have demonstrated that aerosolized SARS CoV 2 can remain viable and infectious for hours and even days on contaminated surfaces SARS CoV 2 is especially persistence on inanimate surfaces like metal glass or plastic where the virus has remained viable and infectious after 9 days Nevertheless SARS CoV 2 can be inactivated by following surface disinfection procedures  ethanol 05% hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute,10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.3.03
0,coronaviruses may not persist on surfaces more than pair seconds,A number of other factors may influence the survival of microorganisms on surfaces Clearly the material character of a surface itself may play in important role However inconsistent results are reported for the influence of type of materials on microbial survival Some authors described that the type of material did not affect the persistence of Echovirus Adenovirus Para Influenza virus Rotavirus Respiratory syncytial virus Poliovirus or Norovirus Other investigators found that persistence was favoured on non porous surfaces for Influenza virus on formica and gloves for Respiratory syncytial virus and on hand pieces of telephones for Feline calicivirus Other factors for a longer persistence of viruses include the presence of faecal suspension and a higher bio inoculum Interestingly and by nature Urease activity enhances the survival of Haemophilus influenzae at a reduced pH,
0,coronaviruses may not persist on surfaces more than pair seconds,The most common nosocomial coronaviruses may well survive or persist on inanimate surfaces for up to a month The risk of transmission via touching contaminated paper is low while respiratory and fecal specimens can maintain infectivity for quite a long time at room temperature SARS CoV 2 could exist in the air in poorly ventilated buses for at least 30 min Absorbent materials like cotton are safer than nonabsorptive materials for protection from viral infection Proper preventive strategies such as washing hands and wearing masks are critical for containing COVID 19,10.12998/wjcc.v8.i8.1391

0,smoking can prevent the new coronavirus disease,During the coronavirus disease pandemic the issue of tobacco smoking and risk for acute respiratory infection is again topical Much of the global focus on tobacco prevention and cessation focuses around noninfective respiratory cardiovascular and cancer related deaths and much of the e cigarette promotional rhetoric revolves around potentially saving billions of lives that might otherwise be lost due to these non infective outcomes The risk of infectious complications is however the predominant focus and concern in low income and middle income countries particularly during pandemics Some countries for example South Africa and India have banned the sale of tobacco products during lockdown periods Whether this ban is justified and supported by evidence of harm from the combined effect of tobacco use and COVID 19 is uncertain as is whether current smokers can be expected to simply stop during a pandemic,10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30239-3
0,smoking can prevent the new coronavirus disease,Governments should act to reduce smoking rates in all countries in accordance with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control FCTC and initiate a stimulus package for health as they have done for business at the time of this outbreak pandemic including all communicable pulmonary diseases and Covid 19 as it is possible that smoking exacerbates contraction transmission and mortality It appears that smoking has the potential to upregulate the ACE2 receptor making smokers and COPD patients more vulnerable to Covid 19 The new electronic smoking devices also do not seem to be safer options ACE2 thus could be a potential therapeutic target for SARS CoV 2 and should be prioritized for further research,10.3390/jcm9030841
0,smoking can prevent the new coronavirus disease,Smokers are known to be more vulnerable to infectious diseases including influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus Smoking has also been found to be associated with negative progression and adverse outcomes for COVID 19 The current evidence comes from five Chinese studies which find smokers who are hospitalised with COVID 19 have 2 9 times greater risk of serious COVID 19 complications compared with non smokers In the short term smoking cessation leads to reduced respiratory symptoms and brochial hyperresponsiveness and prevents unnecessary decline in lung function The COVID 19 pandemic is having a major impact on the whole world and has gained huge public awareness Globally millions of people search for health related information online which makes Web search queries on Google Trends a valuable source of information on collective health trends,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.04.012

0,smoking can prevent the new coronavirus disease,Evidence from other respiratory viruses respiratory syncytial virus has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 the receptor for SARS CoV 2 However as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID 19 vulnerability in different groups,10.1371/journal.pone.0233147
0,smoking can prevent the new coronavirus disease,The damage caused to the lungs by smoking makes patients more susceptible to pulmonary infections both bacterial and viral Smokers are 34% more likely than non smokers to contract the flu Han and colleagues conclude that literature evidence showed that smoking was consistently associated with a higher risk of hospital admissions after influenza infection It is now the fourth leading cause of death in the world Vaccination against influenza is strongly recommended for patients with COPD as the frequency and progression of exacerbations are strongly linked to respiratory viruses in 30% of cases Rubin et al found that COPD patients who were prone to viral infections had higher exacerbation rates more inflammation and loss of lung function compared to those with existing exacerbating disease conditions Symptomatology and mortality in influenza infected smokers were also enhanced According to the WHO comorbidities are associated with a high percentage of Covid 19 related deaths In conjunction with the complications arising from comorbidities in patients who smoke we put forth the question of whether smoking smoking induced health conditions and comorbidities in combination is culminating in a high risk demographic for both contraction of the virus and the severe presentation of Covid 19,10.3390/jcm9030841
0,smoking can prevent the new coronavirus disease,Within the several habit-related factors smoking deserves particular consideration Smoking is a risk for many respiratory diseases and undoubtedly also for COVID-19 The European Respiratory Society reported results of different studies concluding that smokers are 14 times more likely to die from COVID-19 but only a few studies definitely advise to stop smoking and to our knowledge no country has taken strong prevention measures As regards the individual susceptibility of smokers toward respiratory diseases such as influenza chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD tuberculosis TB or other lung pathological conditions there are no doubts about a direct association,10.3390/ijms21103474
0,smoking can prevent the new coronavirus disease,Acknowledging the destructive effects of smoking on health the importance of smoking prevention and cessation to preserve health and the highly addictive nature of nicotine we strongly encourage all patients to refrain from smoking as the long term effects of this hazardous habit far outweigh potential benefits in preventing SARS CoV 2 infection Nevertheless the strong negative association demonstrated in this study between smoking and COVID 19 incidence may offer promising new directions for fighting this disease based on a better understanding of the mechanisms by which smoking reduces the risk of SARS CoV 2 infection,10.1101/2020.06.01.20118877

1,source this virus is identified there is risk new outbreaks,At the moment the ultimate course of COVID 19 spread is still uncertain Hopefully the stringent measures of social distancing adopted in all developed countries will lower the number of new daily diagnosed cases of infection to none or few However without an efficacious vaccine the risk of a new outbreak of COVID 19 infection will remain consistently high thus requiring maintaining risk reducing precautions for a long period This means that even in the best desirable scenario of having only a low level of local circulation of the virus corresponding to an individual low risk of infection many of the measures currently adopted should be maintained For instance careful triage of patients before being admitted to the oncology department should be continued In addition an increase and optimized use of telemedicine resources should be adopted not only to reduce unnecessary accesses to the hospitals during the COVID 19 epidemic but also as an occasion to rethink the way to provide a more convenient efficient and effective health care service for patients with cancer,10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0316
1,source this virus is identified there is risk new outbreaks,The critical mix for a successful pandemic outbreak is a fast and efficient human to human transfer of the pathogen where humans have little or no immunity against it no vaccines currently exist and supply of antiviral drugs is insufficient or not existing Most of these can now be seen during the current COVID 19 outbreak In other words the outbreak of COVID 19 is not a real surprise the surprise is linked to its extremely high infection rate allowing a very fast worldwide progression In the Global Risk Report of 2006 written after the Avian Flu H5N1 Pandemic in 2003 it is mentioned that if the virus can no longer be contained and person to person infection were to become common place âthe vulnerabilities of our interconnected global system would intensify the human and economic impact,10.1007/s10669-020-09779-8
1,COVID-19 can be spread through coins and bills,While social distancing is widely promoted it may not completely prevent fomite transmission if common objects such as doorhandles stair banisters table surfaces utensils or taps are contaminated While the survival of viruses such as SARS CoV 2 on surfaces varies with temperature humidity and many other factors Several studies suggest viable virus can remain for several days on some materials with a 10 fold reduction per day in viral load Transmission from an infected person to a new person via a fomite such as a door handle tap or even money and subsequent self inoculation via nose eyes or mouth is suspected to be significant second only to direct droplet transmission,10.1101/2020.05.21.20109447

1,is possible test positive for covid-19 after having negative test,A total of 408 patients with positive MERS CoV test results were treated at the referring hospital We excluded 72 patients who had only 1 swab result available in the system and were treated in the initial years of the disease Of the remaining 336 patients 300 89% had a positive result after 1 swab 324 96% had a positive result after 2 consecutive swabs and 328 97% had a positive result after 3 consecutive swabs Of the total cases 46 13% had a positive MERS CoV test then a negative test followed by positive test results CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that 2 to 3 nasopharyngeal samples are needed to produce the highest yield of positive results for MERS CoV In addition 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients from MERS CoV Evaluation of the yield of sputum samples is needed to assess the effectiveness against nasopharyngeal swabs,10.1016/j.ajic.2018.08.020
1,is possible test positive for covid-19 after having negative test,For the time dependent analysis of conversion rates we considered initially positive patients with any Detected or Indeterminate SARS CoV 2 result obtained during the first calendar day of testing rather than the first positive test to reduce bias due to nasopharyngeal sampling inadequacy Conversely patients without a result of 219 Detected or Indeterminate in the first day were labeled as initially negative Among the 2413 initially negative repeat tested patients 18% became positive upon repeat  testing on subsequent days Among the patients with repeat testing who had initial results of Invalid Not Detected  or Indeterminate 4% had Detected results upon repeat testing in the first day of testing This increase in positivity rate most likely results from a false negative initial test due to pre analytic factors such as sample inadequacy incorrect swabbing technique or stochastic sampling bias from low viral loads in the patient nasopharynx After the first day of testing repeating invalid negative or indeterminate results on the same day resulted in about 233 08% of additional positive results per day for a total of 184% positives that were missed by the first test,10.1101/2020.05.06.20093575
1,is possible test positive for covid-19 after having negative test,Among all the repeat tested patients 23% were positive on the first test 26% when 165 indeterminate results were included If a negative test was repeated on the first day the 166 positivity rate increased to 26% 29% with indeterminate results Overall positivity 167 among repeat tested patients over the course of the study period was 399% in contrast to 168 49% for single tested patients When indeterminate results were counted as 169 positive 42% of repeat tested patients were positive over the course of the study period 170 in contrast to 50% of single tested patients,10.1101/2020.05.06.20093575
1,is possible test positive for covid-19 after having negative test,As shown above the probability of a false negative test result depends on the number of days since symptom onset This means that simple reports of positive and negative test counts among individuals who are only tested once will underestimate the true number of positive tests in that group We can illustrate the potential impact this has on average false negative test rates by supposing that the time from onset of symptoms to testing follows a gamma distribution,10.1101/2020.04.05.20053355
1,is possible test positive for covid-19 after having negative test,A positive or negative test for the SARS CoV2 antibody is difficult to interpret at this time It is not yet known if antibodies serve as an indication of the presence or absence of protective or sustained immunity Negative SARS CoV 2 antibody results do not rule out SARS CoV 2 infection particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS CoV 2 infection or to inform infection status,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104468
1,is possible test positive for covid-19 after having negative test,Overall we found that the Rapid Test appears to be a valid method for detecting both negative SARS CoV 2 and positive IgG patients On the contrary the Rapid Test does not appear to be as effective for the detection of positive or negative IgM subjects and therefore it should not be performed unless it is followed by RT PCR,10.1101/2020.05.30.20117424
1,is possible test positive for covid-19 after having negative test,Among the patients with initially negative results 18% became positive upon repeat testing Only 58% of any time positive patients had a result of detected on the first test The clinical sensitivity of COVID 19 molecular assays is estimated between 66% and 95% depending on the unknown number of false negative results in single tested patients Conversion to a negative result is unlikely to occur before 15 to 20 days after initial testing or 20 30 days after the onset of symptoms with 50% conversion occurring at 28 days after initial testing Forty nine initially positive patients converted to negative and then back to positive in subsequent days Conversion from first day negative to positive results increased linearly with each day of testing reaching 25% probability in 20 days In summary our study provides estimates of the clinical performance of SARS CoV 2 molecular assays and suggests time frames for appropriate repeat testing namely 15 to 20 days after a positive test and the same or next 2 days after a negative test in a patient with high suspicion for COVID 19,10.1101/2020.05.06.20093575
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,Patients and care providers should wash hands in accordance with the seven-step washing method Hand hygiene should be performed after using the rest room and before meals upon returning home after contacting garbage or touching animals before and after the PD-related procedures and after the disposal of the PD drainage fluid It is necessary to wash hands with soap and hand sanitizer before conducting PD Antibacterial hand soap is recommended,10.1007/s00467-020-04555-x
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,We should wash our hand with soap frequently If the soap is not available we should use alcohol based sanitizer,10.1101/2020.04.22.20075572
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,Hands can be a vector for transmitting pathogenic microorganisms to foodstuffs and drinks and to the mouths of susceptible hosts Hand washing is the primary barrier to prevent transmission of enteric pathogens via cross contamination from infected persons Conventional hand washing involves the use of water soap and friction to remove dirt and microorganisms The availability of hand sanitizing products for use when water and soap are unavailable has increased in recent years Twenty eight scientific publications were ultimately included in the review Analysis of this literature revealed various limitations in the scientific information owing to the absence of a standardized protocol for evaluating the efficacy of hand products and variation in experimental conditions However despite conflicting results scientific evidence seems to support the historical skepticism about the use of waterless hand sanitizers in food preparation settings Water and soap appear to be more effective than waterless products for removal of soil and microorganisms from hands Alcohol based products achieve rapid and effective inactivation of various bacteria but their efficacy is generally lower against nonenveloped viruses The presence of food debris significantly affects the microbial inactivation rate of hand sanitizers,10.4315/0362-028x.jfp-15-492
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,Keeping hands clean is a fundamental and essential step to avoid getting sick while limiting the transmission of germs to others CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water whenever possible as it remarkably reduces the amount of all types of microbes and dirt on the skin surface Both the soaps and alcohol-based sanitizers work by dissolving the lipid membranes of microbes thereby inactivating them Thus the sanitizer serves as an alternative when the soap and water are not readily available The suggested minimum alcohol content of 60% is needed for it to exert the microbicidal effect As compared to soap alcohol-based sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs including norovirus and Clostridium difficile the common pathogens that can cause diarrhoea,10.3390/ijerph17093326
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,Hand hygiene is performed with either soap and water or alcohol based hand sanitizer According to the CDC washing with soap and water for 15 20 seconds should be performed when hands are visibly soiled after known exposures to Clostridium difficile after known or suspected exposures to patients with diarrhea during a norovirus outbreak when exposure to Bacillus anthracis is suspected or proven before eating and after using the restroom If none of those situations are applicable alcohol based hand sanitizer is recommended and considered the most effective product Alcohol based hand sanitizer composed of 60 95% alcohol to maintain efficacy is an easy and effective manner for hand hygiene that takes roughly 20 seconds to dry Depending upon the situation alcohol based hand sanitizer can easily provide staff with an effective and timely method for cleaning their hands which significantly improves compliance,10.1007/978-3-030-03053-7_8
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,Although hand sanitizers may be less effective than soaps in some situations it is undeniable that they are the preferred form of hand hygiene in healthcare settings The use of alcohol based sanitizer may improve the compliance of healthcare workers to hand hygiene practices as they are easily accessible and take less time to use Around 2 3 mL of liquid equivalent to two pumps from a dispenser is deposited on the palm and rubbed all over the surfaces of both hands for 25 30 s to maximize the efficacy of the sanitizer,10.3390/ijerph17093326
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,Hand washing is another crucial element of proper hygiene As simple as it sounds hand washing is an essential step in preventing the spread of any disease Hands should be washed with soap and water for 30 s and after washing one should avoid touching contaminated surfaces with their hands As an alternative to soap and water alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be used to disinfect hands before patient care,10.1007/978-3-030-30085-2_7
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,Considering family caregivers perspectives on contagious disease transmission and prevention a health education intervention that uses culturally appropriate messages based on awareness of infections and the importance of hand hygiene could be developed Such interventions would need to be simple enough for health care workers to implement them daily in the setting of high turnover rates of patients and family caregivers Pilot interventions in some public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh could explore the feasibility acceptability and effectiveness of such an approach However even when family caregivers are highly motivated poor hospital infrastructure including lack of water and handwashing stations may be barriers to handwashing practices In settings where handwashing stations with running water and soap are unavailable use of hand sanitizer could be one alternative for cleaning hands Hand sanitizer has been found to be effective in killing viruses and bacteria and has the added advantage that it does not require water However family caregivers in Bangladesh may be unfamiliar with this cleansing agent and would require training on its use,10.1016/j.ajic.2013.09.012
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,Hand hygiene should be performed before and after every patient contact whenever hands come into contact with patients blood body fluids secretions and other contaminants or touch patients immediate environment and before and after donning and removing PPE Hand hygiene should be performed using water and soap when hands are visibly soiled with contaminants and if not using alcohol based hand rub sanitizer for 20 30 s applying enough sanitizer to cover all hand surfaces and rubbing until the sanitizer is completely dry on the hands Hand hygiene using water and soap should be performed as follows wet hands with water apply enough soap rub hands to cover all hand surfaces with soap rinse and thoroughly dry hands with disposable towels time required 40 60 s Healthcare facilities must supply hand hygiene sinks and products,10.3947/ic.2015.47.4.278
1,if soap and water are not available it can be used hand sanitizer 60% alcohol,According to the Five Moments for Hand Hygiene recommendations from WHO hand hygiene should be performed: before and after every patient contact after body fluid exposure or risk after touching a patients immediate environment and before clean aseptic procedures Hand hygiene should be performed using soap and water when hands are visibly soiled with contaminants and if not using alcohol based hand rub sanitizer for 20â30 s Hand hygiene should also be performed even when wearing gloves for procedures Hand hygiene is the most critical infection prevention measure The dialysis unit should provide continuous education and supervision regarding the importance and recommended approach to hand hygiene and provide the necessary equipment such as a sufficient number of sinks with soap dispensers paper towels hand lotions and alcohol based hand rubs placed at each patient station,10.1007/s00467-020-04555-x
0,There is risk of spread COVID-19 from food products packaging,One of the most important issues to address for consumers who are concerned with the food risk posed by SARS CoV 2 is the possibility that food products or food packaging can be contaminated by the virus Foodborne transmission of SARS CoV 2 needs to be studied Studies on other viruses have revealed their survival on the surfaces of food products or on surfaces that have been in contact with contaminated food This possibility should also be considered for SARS CoV 2 Already EU Commission has been highlighted that use of packaging material contaminated by the staff may increase the risk for the consumers in this pandemic term Food products prepared from exotic or wild animals should be periodically checked In particular animals consumed in undeveloped countries should be tested to eliminate the rapid global spread of SARS CoV 2 Food products that are packaged or canned could be considered safer Even so especially canned materials should be washed well using boiled water In addition fresh food products that are chilled should be well cooked after purchase to eliminate the potential risk of contracting infection and the midpoint temperature of the products must be checked before being consumed,10.1007/s13337-020-00611-0
0,There is risk of spread COVID-19 from food products packaging,There is currently no scientific evidence to indicate a concern with food products related to SARS CoV 2 according to the FDA However consumption of meat or organs of infected animals can result in zoonotic foodborne infections China has both a huge population and a history of the consumption of wild or exotic animals In Chinese food culture live and slaughtered wild animals are considered to be more nutritious Live and dead chickens pheasants bats marmots deer dogs pigs civets and organs of rabbits are also sold along with wild animals in food markets When people keep live and dead animals in close proximity contact or cross contamination can easily lead to the spread of the virus Furthermore it has been suggested that the transmission of SARS CoV 2 to humans may have been promoted by unhygienic conditions such as unclean seafood tanks body fluids of live and dead animals or insufficient air quality conditions,10.1007/s13337-020-00611-0
0,There is risk of spread COVID-19 from food products packaging,However little attention has been paid to food safety and its potential linkage with the coronavirus disease COVID 19 pandemic SARS CoV 2 spread from staff to food products or food surfaces is conceivable At least instead of consuming unpackaged or uncovered foods consumption of boiled or canned foods processed at high temperatures should be preferred Before consumption consumers should clean the surface of canned foods In addition to recommending or enforcing simple precautions such as using masks governments must conduct mandatory SARS CoV 2 tests regularly and intermittently for personnel who handle food materials or supporting materials eg plastic pouches Local markets such as those in Wuhan which sell live animals and exotic foods for consumption are a concern Trade of exotic or wild animals unhygienic marketplace conditions and not cooking at high temperatures ought to be prohibited The consumption of vitamins minerals and other food derived compounds such as omega fatty acids is a prudent way to improve the performance of the immune system In addition nano encapsulated materials with controlled release properties may be useful in protecting food products and packaging from SARS CoV 2 contamination,10.1007/s13337-020-00611-0
0,There is risk of spread COVID-19 from food products packaging,Humans have for millennia faced many health problems caused by bacterial or viral infections In particular bacteria are a major cause of foodborne illnesses Therefore studies on foodborne illnesses have focused on bacterial spoilage in food and foodborne pathogens with comparatively less attention given to viruses Generally a virus is defined as an infectious agent that is typically 20 300 nm in size contains RNA or DNA and requires a living host cell for its replication The collective host range of viruses is broad and includes animals humans plants and bacteria Serious diseases caused by viruses include Ebola acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and avian influenza The latter two occur globally Coronaviruses CoVs are members of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae Illnesses caused by CoVs include the common cold caused by HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43 middle east respiratory syndrome caused by MERS CoV severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS CoV and COVID 19 which is caused by SARS CoV 2 The latter is the cause of an ongoing pandemic,10.1007/s13337-020-00611-0
0,There is risk of spread COVID-19 from food products packaging,There is definite concern about food industry workers who should be tested for SARS CoV 2 to eliminate the potential risk of contamination of food products In food processing settings including settings where food is only slightly processed infected workers may contaminate food products In addition worker to worker transmission is a risk in settings where personnel are in close contact with each other A prudent strategy can be for healthy food industry personnel to wear a mask whenever there is a SARS CoV 2 risk worldwide,10.1007/s13337-020-00611-0
0,There is risk of spread COVID-19 from food products packaging,Thereby the handling of packages should be followed by extensive hand washing or sanitizing in order to minimize any risk from touching food potentially exposed to coronavirus Besides the FDA suggested that sanitization and cleaning of surfaces is a preferred precaution for food restaurants and kitchens compared to environmental testing for the COVID 19 virus Nevertheless in some food serving places other precautions have been taken For instance some health authorities restaurants and cafeterias in Central Europe Belgium stopped serving rare steaks and meats However these precautions are mainly related to food handling and preparation practices suggested by the WHO mainly to avoid cross contamination between cooked and uncooked foods including as mentioned cooking meat thoroughly and others eg washing hands,10.3390/foods9040523
0,There is risk of spread COVID-19 from food products packaging,The potential linkage between SARS CoV 2 infection and food safety is an important issue for governments worldwide to consider During times when the risk of infection is higher such as during the ongoing pandemic consumption of boiled or canned foods processed at high temperatures is prudent in addition to following general hygiene rules Governments should mandate the testing of food industry personnel for SARS CoV 2 The consumption of exotic or wild animal based food products in countries with large populations such as China should be avoided to lessen the chance of a new outbreak Supplementation of diets with vitamins minerals and other compounds can increase immunity and reduce the chances of contracting the infection Novel approaches in the food industry should be applied instead of conventional practices In this regard nanofibers nanoparticles and nanoencapsulated bioactive materials could be utilized to bolster food safety Depending on the release time of the payload from nanosized materials food packaging can be labeled to provide information to the consumers The COVID 19 outbreak has spread worldwide but precautions related to the food industry must be taken at the international level The outcomes of these precautions should be disseminated globally,10.1007/s13337-020-00611-0

1,Sick household members should use a separate room and bathroom,Patients should be placed in isolation rooms with negative pressure at least 12 air changes per hour a dedicated bathroom and if possible an anteroom If negative pressure rooms are not available choose rooms with natural ventilation with airflow of at least 160 per patient If single rooms are not accessible patients with suspected SARS CoV 2 infection should be placed in the same room Patients beds should be located at least 1 m away from each other It is critical that the area prepared to receive suspect patients is equipped with all the necessary PPE All patients should wear a medical mask It is critical to limit the number of healthcare professionals in contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID 19 It is better to put together a team of healthcare professionals who deal exclusively with suspected or confirmed cases to minimise the risk of transmission A reminder to all the people who enter the patients room is recommended including healthcare workers and family members,10.1183/16000617.0068-2020
1,Sick household members should use a separate room and bathroom,It is important to note that social distancing for healthcare workers also includes distancing within the home  We have recommended that clinicians who are redeployed pack a second set of clothes to change into after doffing the uniform they used to treat the COVID 19 positive patients  They are recommended to then remove those clothes prior to entering their home sometimes through an accessory entrance if possible and place everything in a laundry bag to be immediately cleaned  They should then proceed immediately to the shower to decontaminate It is recommended to use a different bathroom than other occupants in the household If this is not possible one should immediately clean the bathroom with disinfectant after use Surgical masks are donned in the home and social distancing during meals and other interactions should apply  If allowable one should sleep in a separate part of the house or apartment Some clinicians prefer housing quarters away from the home although this has not been explicitly recommended by health authorities Each institution should attempt to provide resources for available housing,10.1016/j.spinee.2020.05.539
1,Sick household members should use a separate room and bathroom,Marginalized communities are more susceptible to COVID 19 for multiple reasons Many of our participants are living in conditions where they are unable to follow COVID 19 public health and safety recommendations during this pandemic Community members who live in shelters and SROs report living in unclean facilities not having access to cleaning supplies and not being able to properly physically distance from their neighbors Many SROs have shared bathrooms with multiple doors to touch between ones own room and the bathroom and some personal rooms do not have sinks for handwashing In addition to jeopardizing their physical health these shared living situations often make participating in research nearly impossible since there is limited privacy in which to respond to sensitive research questions,10.1007/s10461-020-02920-3
1,Sick household members should use a separate room and bathroom,The feasibility of performing aerosol generating procedures will depend on the patients location within the hospital Most of the evidence available on NIRS devices as invasive procedures and the risk of transmitting respiratory pathogens to healthcare staff concerns orotracheal intubation patients with artificial airways and non invasive ventilation although the results come from small low quality studies and are therefore difficult to interpret In mild cases therefore the patient should be placed in a negative pressure room If this is not available the patient should be place in a single occupancy room with bathroom The door of the room must be closed at all times 39  Serious cases with severe hypoxaemia should be admitted to special units c For intrahospital transfer both the patient and the staff member transferring the patient must wear surgical masks During transfer the patients bed must be covered with a clean disposable sheet that is then removed and disposed of as hazardous medical waste group 3 biological agents,10.1016/j.redare.2020.05.001
1,Sick household members should use a separate room and bathroom,and you must maintain sufficient distance to other people approximately 2 meters six feet asymptomatic but infected for 14 days asymptomatic but possibly infected exposed to a positive casefor 14 days If possible you should live in different accommodations but as this may not be possible in the majority of cases you should avoid close contact You should avoid sharing a bed when possible sharing food and kitchen utensils cutlery glasses napkins bath and shower towels hand towels tea towels etc and any other objects without cleaning them properly If possible avoid using shared spaces such as kitchens or bathrooms and remember of regularly ventilating shared spaces If you do not have a second bathroom or WC clean the shared bathroom by wiping the surfaces you have to touch When sharing places keep safe distancing,10.1016/s1470-2045(20)30278-3
1,Sick household members should use a separate room and bathroom,The only way to completely avoid such risk is to separate infected individuals in dedicated quarantine centers as has been done partially in Italy confining infected people in individual hotel rooms Even with reduced admissions to hospital patients that are treated at home and assisted by household members strictly comply with the home isolation guidelines issued by experts ranging from sanitary hygiene measures including waste management cleaning of contaminated surfaces and household laundering to interhuman contact measures among family members the caregiver of a suspected or confirmed COVID 19 infected individual in home isolation must be in good health and maintain a distance of at least 1 m avoiding direct contact with oral or respiratory secretions faeces and urine; moreover a surgical mask and disposable gloves should always be used Hence we can safely assume that in house transmission is severely limited,10.1038/s41591-020-0883-7
1,Sick household members should use a separate room and bathroom,he home environment particularly the kitchen and bathroom serves as a reservoir of large numbers of microorganisms particularly Enterobacteriacaeand infectious disease transmission has been demonstrated to occur in 6 60% of households in which one member is ill Current food preparation and cleaning practices provide multiple opportunities for intra household member spread Routine cleaning is often sufficient but in cases of household infection may not adequately reduce environmental contamination The effectiveness of disinfectants varies considerably and depends on how they are used as well as their intrinsic efficacy The behavioral aspects of infection prevention in the home eg foodhandling and cleaning practices warrant increased public attention and education,10.1023/a:1016378226861
1,Sick household members should use a separate room and bathroom,It should be noted that the toilet is a small area that is commonly shared by patients in the relatively large isolation rooms Thus the personal spaces of these patients overlap in the toilet area and thus are likely to generate an additive contamination effect and may explain why the toilet surfaces were particularly likely to be positive Nevertheless the duration of a patients stay in the toilet is brief as only mild symptomatic patients stayed on this floor Additionally the surface material or finish inside the toilets may allow a better transfer during sampling by swabs In this context it is known that there is generally a higher surfacetouch transfer rate from smooth to rough surfaces and most toilet surfaces are made to be smooth We failed to detect any viruses on non toilet object surfaces in the patients rooms unlike in a 2020 study by who detected positive samples in one patients room and in toilet sites although anteroom and corridor samples were negative It is interesting that the patient in their study had no pneumonia or diarrhoea but that his stool samples were positive for SARS CoV 2,10.1101/2020.04.03.20052175
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,However more and more young people have been diagnosed along with the pandemic progression of the disease and the development of rapid COVID 19 testing techniques Currently we know that young people also can be seriously affected by SARS CoV 2,10.1097/jcma.0000000000000323
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,An overview of the clinical characteristics of confirmed cases in China alerted the world that young age does not protect against infection Disease severity however varies by age with more elderly people becoming seriously ill and by underlying medical condition The impact on peak medical demand thus will be even greater if we succeed in maximizing social distancing of the most vulnerable and most frail patients those who are more likely to become seriously ill,10.1159/000507537
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,Interestingly COVID 19 seems to be strangely and tragically selective Only some infected people become sick Although most critically ill COVID 19 patients are either elderly or have underlying medical problems such as cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes mellitus or cancer some previously healthy and even relatively young individuals have died from COVID 19 Sequencing of patients genomes for DNA variations associated with severe illness may help to explain this mystery,10.4269/ajtmh.20-0240
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,Epidemiological proofs show that SARS CoV 2 in children is less intense than adults One of the most common parameters for the severity of the COVID 19 is the chronic illness like high blood pressure diabetes and cardiovascular disease Based on this fact children appear to be at lower risk due to absence of such aliments at young age This trend has been also seen during SARS CoV outbreak in 2002 with a relatively lower mortality rate and mild symptoms compared to adults Innate immunity of the human body is critical and is the first line of defense for battling the infectious diseases This defense mechanism shows an exponential decline in the later life span which leads to increase in the incidence of infectious disease For example diseases like chickenpox and measles are fatal to adults almost 25 times more than children,10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.05.024
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,Interestingly there is high variability in these estimates when comparing countries and continents as well as differences in COVID 19 severity between males and females and between different age groups Differences in response to SARS CoV 2 infection between individuals and countries may be explained by diminished immune response in the elderly comorbidities or smoking habits but severe COVID 19 cases have also been observed in young individuals seemingly without risk factors This indicates that most factors explaining COVID 19 severity are still unknown It is therefore critical to understand the mechanisms behind COVID 19 severity in order to provide appropriate prevention measures and adequate triage strategies guide the drug discovery process and ultimately combat the SARS CoV 2 pandemic The large variation in SARS CoV 2 infection rates and COVID 19 severity could potentially be explained by genetic differences between hosts While large scale genetic studies of COVID 19 patients are being assembled such as those coordinated by the COVID host genetics consortium it is worthwhile to evaluate the effects of genetic variants in genes involved in SARS CoV 2 infection on human phenotypes including quantitative traits taking advantage of already existing cohorts,10.1101/2020.04.22.20074963
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,Following is a short overview of related studies In a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC only 291 of 2572 children who were infected with SARS CoV 2 were symptomatic though this may be due to poor reporting It has also been reported that most COVID 19 cases in children are mild even though serious COVID 19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group Zhang conclude that children are less likely to be infected compared to adults by about 60% while Bi conclude that children were as likely to be infected as adults Dong report that children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID 19 with no significant gender difference Kelvin suggest that there is clear evidence that children are susceptible to SARS CoV 2 infection but frequently do not display notable disease symptoms raising the possibility that children could be facilitators of viral transmission,10.1101/2020.06.03.20121145
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,Children with confirmed diagnosis had milder clinical course than suspected cases which could include other prevalent viruses like respiratory syncytial virus influenza and para influenza etc in this age group indicating that severity of SARS CoV 2 illness could be milder than other acute respiratory infections in this age group The median time from onset of illness to diagnosis was 2 Proportion of severe and critical cases was 10% 7% 4% 4% and 3% for the age group of  respectively indicating that young children especially infants were more vulnerable to severe SARS CoV 2 infection One child died This study did not describe frequency of individual symptoms in their population Patients with severe manifestation usually develop features of hypoxemia and hypoperfusion by end of first week Commonly described complications are acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS myocarditis septic shock disseminated intravascular coagulation,10.1007/s12098-020-03292-1
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,As the outbreak spreads rapidly beyond the epicentre of Wuhan it becomes clear that infants and children of all ages are susceptible to this infection In China there have been more than 1200 paediatric cases Most paediatric patients acquire the infection through household contact with infected adults The disease in children is usually self limiting and most infected children will recover uneventfully within 7 10 days Other than symptoms of the respiratory tract many children may present with gastrointestinal symptoms Older children are more likely to have asymptomatic infection Although deaths related to SARS CoV 2 are rarely reported in the paediatric age group young children and those with underlying medical conditions are more likely to develop severe illness Only a small fraction of neonates born to infected mother would acquire the virus by vertical transmission,10.1136/archdischild-2020-319261
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,Data for many variables are unlikely to be missing at random and as such these results must be interpreted with caution Because of the high percentage of missing data statistical comparisons could not be conducted Second because many cases occurred only days before publication of this report the outcome for many patients is unknown and this analysis might underestimate severity of disease or symptoms that manifested later in the course of illness Third COVID 19 testing practices differ across jurisdictions and might also differ across age groups In many areas prioritization of testing for severely ill patients likely occurs which would result in overestimation of the percentage of patients with COVID 19 infection who are hospitalized including those treated in an ICU among all age groups Finally this analysis compares clinical characteristics of pediatric cases persons aged 18 years with those of cases among adults aged 18â64 years Severe COVID 19 disease appears to be more common among adults at the high end of this age range and therefore cases in young adults might be more similar to those among children than suggested by the current analysis,10.15585/mmwr.mm6914e4
0,young are not likely to become severely ill with COVID-19,A valid question is why some COVID 19 positive test cases present with only mild symptoms compared to others that have severe symptomatology ending up with fatal outcomes So far all data indicates that people who are older immunocompromised or have significant underlying conditions such as heart failure coronary heart disease arrhythmia diabetic nephropathy and mainly any kind of limited lung function asthma acute or chronic pulmonary disease among others are more likely to develop poorer outcomes and multiorgan failure However it is unclear why COVID 19 has caused the death of perhaps thousands of young and not so young people without any apparent underlying health conditions Scientists are desperately trying to unravel why COVID 19 can be lethal to young and apparently healthy individuals,10.3390/pathogens9050389
1,Taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead more severe infection COVID-19,At present while there are no established drugs to treat COVID 19 some are showing promise Chloroquine phosphate an anti malarial has been shown to be useful in treating COVID 19 pneumonia Remdesivir an antiviral drug developed to treat Ebola has been suggested to have positive effects in COVID 19 infected patients with severe respiratory disease These patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated liver function tests Some patients with severe COVID 19 disease develop cytokine storm and this may be prevented with toclizumab Passive infusion of polyclonal plasma antibodies from persons who have had COVID 19 infection has been suggested and monoclonal antibodies to COVID 19 are under development Finally COVID 19 binds to the soluble portion of the ACE 2 receptor and this seems essential for the virus to enter cells The possibility of a monoclonal antibody to the soluble portion of the ACE 2 receptor is under consideration It is uncertain whether stopping the use of ACE 1 inhibitors which increase ACE 2 receptors should be undertaken However this may explain the increased virulence of COVID 19 in persons with hypertension and diabetes mellitus COVID 19 infected patients may do worse if taking ibuprofen so it is recommended that patients take acetaminophen or paracetamol for fever and pain,10.1007/s12603-020-1349-9
1,Taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead more severe infection COVID-19,While the possible antiviral activity of indomethacin a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug against SARS has been reported now there is a concern in the use of these pharmacological drugs in patients with COVID 19 In March 2020 the use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen as an antipyretic drug in COVID 19 has been warned and acetaminophen has been recommended There was a report that in 4 young patients with COVID 19 and no underlying health problem the use of ibuprofen worsened the COVID 19 symptoms It has been speculated that its anti inflammatory properties could damp down the immune system and prolong viral shedding It may reduce inflammation and fever in patients with COVID 19 and diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections Long term use of ibuprofen may cause gastrointestinal bleeding fluid retention and renal dysfunction even at therapeutic doses In toxic doses it may result in respiratory depression hypotension or shock depressed mental status severe metabolic acidosis severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage life threatening electrolyte imbalances or arrhythmias,10.1007/s00210-020-01901-6
1,Taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead more severe infection COVID-19,Antipyretic analgesics should be prescribed as needed for pain and fever and should not be administrated on routine bases These agents might mask fever and delay diagnosis and treatment Both paracetamol and NSAIDs can be considered to relieve pain The reports for avoiding ibuprofen are not validated yet These reports suggest that NSAIDs may upregulate ACE receptors which could worsen the disease progression Examples of supportive management are described briefly in several studies For example 199 patients in a clinical study conducted in Jin Yin Tan Hospital received a supportive therapy of supplemental oxygen noninvasive and invasive ventilation antibiotics vasopressor support renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,10.4155/tde-2020-0035
1,Taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead more severe infection COVID-19,Concern about the role of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs in patients with COVID 19 has led to considerable speculation Fang offered an early commentary on COVID 19 that suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs may be associated with worse COVID 19 outcomes and added that ibuprofen may be associated with upregulation of the ACE2 receptors the presumptive entry point of the SARS CoV 2 virus Further immune suppression may occur with some NSAIDs such as but not limited to ibuprofen However Fang and colleagues subsequently cautioned against overinterpretation of these hypotheses that in some cases led to abrupt changes in drug regimens; they state that ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs are important therapeutic drugs and should not be discontinued without careful clinical judgement Likewise a website run by prominent international specialists entitled ACE2 and Hypertension advises individuals taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs not to change their drug therapy unless a physician advises them to do so,10.1007/s40122-020-00173-5
1,Taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead more severe infection COVID-19,The results showed an increased risk of VTE for current users of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs compared with remote users in all categoriessex age and calendar period The results also showed an increased effect of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs on subjects less than 70 years of age No conclusion of causation between the effects of Ibuprofen and thromboembolic event has been made and several limitations in the following area of research exist including conflicting evidence on the role of Ibuprofen on a vascular level Whether Ibuprofen is able to interact with SARS COV2 through any mechanism in also not clear Nevertheless careful considerations should be made on avoiding high dosage of Ibuprofen in subjects at particular risk of thromboembolic events Furthermore factors including decreased mobility and the limited exercise rates resulting from nationwide lockdowns pose frail patients at increased risk of developing thromboembolic events Therefore considerations should be made on two fronts of action Firstly patient advice should be considered regarding possible side effects and avoidance of high dosage of Ibuprofen Secondly a need for a large scale study assessing any possible correlation between NSAIDs and the worsening or increased risk of thromboembolic event in COVID 19 should be considered,10.1111/jth.14901
0,Taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead more severe infection COVID-19,Epidemiologic studies that have identified ibuprofen with negative respiratory outcomes are subject to a number of biases  These biases include protopathic bias where ibuprofen is used to relieve symptoms of a viral infection including COVID 19 making it seem like ibuprofen is the culprit Confounding by disease severity also referred to as channeling bias should also be considered in many of these studies especially those which compared this risk with nonusers Patients with more severe viral infections including influenza or COVID 19 are more likely to use a stronger antiinflammatory drug such as ibuprofen than acetaminophen Therefore a potential harmful outcome is more likely to be caused by a more severe infection for which ibuprofen is prescribed rather than the drug,10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.040
0,Taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead more severe infection COVID-19,Available information to date does not support interruptions or changes in ongoing chronic treatments with ibuprofen or RAS blockers Recommendations are as follows:Based on the currently available evidence effective treatment with RAS blockers should not be discontinued or switched The relatively hypothetical risk of worsening COVID 19 does not justify discontinuing or switching ARBs or ACE inhibitors due to the specific risk of destabilizing blood pressure control stroke heart attack or worsening heart failure Insufficient control of concomitant diseases caused by drug discontinuation could make patients more susceptible to SARS CoV 2 infection and complicate the course of diseaseCurrently there is insufficient evidence to recommend patients who take ibuprofen for medically indicated reasons to change their anti inflammatory medication in light of the COVID 19 pandemic NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period The choice of drug to treat fever or pain in COVID 19 should be based on a benefit risk assessment for known side effects eg kidney damage gastrointestinal ulceration and the respective treatment guidelines that in most cases recommend paracetamol as the first treatment option for fever or pain associated with infections,10.1007/s00210-020-01890-6
0,Taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead more severe infection COVID-19,From the time the World Health Organization WHO first recommended avoiding ibuprofen for COVID 19 patients based on an article published in Lancet safety of ibuprofen in treating symptoms of COVID 19 disease has generated much interest among health care professionals and general public alike Fever and myalgia are among the top 3 symptoms in COVID 19 patients based on data from several studies and meta analysis Ibuprofen is a readily available over the counter medication that is widely used to reduce fever and pain It is only natural that this medication would be widely used in the setting of a pandemic where a large number of patients are being diagnosed with COVID 19 Many people suspected of having COVID 19 infection are not tested due to the lack of availability of widespread testing Some people are also quarantined at home when it does not require they be hospitalized Proper guidance regarding the use of ibuprofen will be helpful to allay fears among the public during this historic ongoing pandemic,10.1097/mjt.0000000000001196
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,The COVID 19 pandemic in the UK has highlighted additional difficulties that disabled people may face Complying with preventative measures like social distancing can be challenging particular for people who rely on carers Disabled people may also be at greater risk of morbidity and mortality if they contract the virus yet in danger of being de prioritised for care Many people with disabilities have ongoing healthcare needs and these need to still be supported during the pandemic Furthermore people may become newly disabled as a result of the pandemic and therefore require appropriate care Good practice examples have emerged for meeting these challenges such as guidance for healthcare professionals on treating people with dementia but these need to be scaled up further and adapted for other settings In conclusion it is clear that a disability inclusive COVID 19 response is needed both in the UK and as the pandemic unfolds globally This response will require inclusion of disability measures within data collection consulting with disabled people and tailoring responses to be appropriate for this group,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15833.1
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,It is clear that disabled people are among the most vulnerable to contracting the virus and experiencing severe morbidity and mortality The context of COVID 19 pandemic and its control will vary widely across the world Although some good practice examples have emerged from the UK these will need to be developed for relevance in different settings There are however some commonalities Additional efforts are needed to ensure that the response is disability inclusive from the planning stage This will require meaningful consultation with disabled people and their supporters leadership at policy and programme level and dedicated budget lines Data collection on disability is needed to allow data disaggregation The right to healthcare for disabled people is not negotiable and must be protected within the COVID 19 pandemic,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15833.1
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,Although most people with disabilities will be identified using the standard disability screening tool this approach is likely to overlook people with intellectual disabilities Intellectual disability represents a small proportion of people with disabilities yet one at high risk for severe health outcomes from COVID 19 infections A recent analysis of national mortality data for deaths attributed to pneumonia prior to the Covid 19 outbreak indicated a 2 to 6 times higher death rate due to pneumonia in people with intellectual and developmental disabilities compared to without these disabilities14 These findings suggest that this population might be particularly vulnerable to dying from Covid 19 infections given that the virus can cause lung complications including pneumonia,10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.100943
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,Unfortunately there is little information that allow public health experts to break out the impact on PwDs Instead we mostly rely upon circumstantial information such as reports of Covid 19 outbreaks among PwDs living in residential care facilities or inferences we can make about the risk of severe health outcomes in PwDs given their higher rates of chronic health conditions It is uncertain whether children with disabilities are at higher risk of serious complications from Covid 19 infection We do know that children with underlying neurologic conditions are more likely to die from seasonal influenza also a respiratory based illness A focus on children with disabilities as a vulnerable group must be a priority in future data collection efforts,10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.100943
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,PwDs represent a diverse group with varying needs in responding to Covid 19 pandemic Data on who is at greatest risk of infection will help us better anticipate and meet the needs of PwDs at high risk From what we know about other respiratory infections people with intellectual disabilities and children with neurologic disabilities may be at higher risk of severe outcomes from Covid 19 disease and we can act now to ensure they have information and supports to mitigate this potential risk We can also anticipate that many PwDs will shelter in place for long periods of time to reduce their risk of infection We can plan services and supports to meet the need for meaningful social interactions to maintain mental health and well being while self isolating Because of the rapid nature of the public health response it is critical to periodically reassess and readjust our approach to best address the needs of PwDs in the months and years to come and to incorporate these new practices into future emergency preparedness responses,10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.100943
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,Implications of the results from this study highlight the value of the targeted interventions as different counties even within the same state may have different characteristics and different needs Furthermore as the association between COVID 19 related fatality and infection is different among different race and health status it is important to further study the impact of the immune system and immune boosting strategies in the at risk population such as people with certain disabilities or those residing in elderly community centers as preventive measure along with other measures based on social distancing guidelines and the ability to work from home This is the first systematic study on the racial health and economic disparity as well as education mobility and COVID 19 infection in the US with the available data from the most severely impacted states Our study had several limitations; the data was not granular and we had missingness especially for smaller and less populated counties Access to the infected patient information and mortality data was not possible and only aggregated data were used,10.1101/2020.04.26.20079756
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,As COVID 19 is transmitted via person to person contact stroke patients undergoing outpatient rehabilitation therapy during the COVID 19 pandemic have an increased risk of infection as contact with other people often cannot be avoided on the way to and from the hospital As the frequency of contact increases the probability of becoming infected with COVID 19 also increases The first 6 months after a stroke is a crucial period for recovery and subacute stroke patients with disabilities regularly undergo rehabilitation therapy at a hospital which means that these patients have a higher risk of COVID 19 Here we suggest the utilization of telerehabilitation for stroke patients to reduce their risk of infection,10.1097/phm.0000000000001468
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,Based on the current available evidence children do not appear to be at higher risk of contracting COVID 19 than adults However children with comorbidities may be vulnerable to severe COVID 19 disease Indeed children with neurological and neuromuscular conditions had an increased risk of respiratory failure when hospitalized with influenza another viral infection Symptom manifestation in children appears to be milder than in adults Further the incidence in individuals under 19 years of age has been quite low and children could even be less susceptible to the COVID 19 disease To the best of our knowledge no review has searched for the impact of COVID 19 on children with brain based disabilities affected by COVID 19,10.1101/2020.05.01.20088021
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,At the early stages of the pandemic concerns began to emerge about the rights of people with disability in responding to COVID 19 Literature already suggested that healthcare providers can make unfounded judgements regarding the quality of life in people with disabilities In the USA the Office of Civil Rights received complaints surrounding the rationing of life saving therapy which adversely affects people with disabilities during the pandemic In a SCI the risk of a poor outcome is arguably higher compared to the normal population In a resource stretched department this may create a tension between equity and efficiency Therefore people with SCI run a higher risk of being affected by healthcare rationing To address this risk healthcare providers should be educated on the ethical considerations when delivering healthcare to those with SCIs Early advanced care planning may be beneficial Civil rights organisations could proactively remind healthcare providers of their obligations,
0,people with disabilities not higher risk for becoming infected COVID-19,We suggest in this perspective that the adverse health impacts on PWDs during the COVID 19 pandemic reveal the everyday emergencies in cities for PWDs and that these can be avoided through more inclusive community planning a whole of government commitment to equal access and implementation of universal design strategies Importantly COVID 19 can place PWDs at a higher risk of infection since some may already have compromised immune and respiratory systems and policy responses such as social distancing can lead to life threatening disruptions in care for those that rely on home health or personal assistants Living in cities may already present health damaging challenges for PWDs such as lack of access to services and employment physical barriers on streets and transportation and smart city technologies that are not made universally accessible We suggest that the current pandemic be viewed as an opportunity for significant urban health reforms on the scale of the sanitary and governance reforms that followed the nineteenth century urban epidemics This perspective offers insights for ensuring the twenty first century response to COVID 19 focuses on promoting more inclusive and healthy cities for all,10.1007/s11524-020-00437-7
1,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,Quarantine is separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to the COVID 19 case but have not yet developed illness symptoms from others who have not been exposed in order to prevent the person person spread of the virus The duration of quarantine depends on the incubation period of COVID 19 which is 14 days from the last date of exposure MOHFW has also suggested quarantine of 14 days for people returning from China Singapore Japan Republic of Korea Iran Italy Spain France and Germany People released from COVID 19 quarantine are not considered a risk for spreading the COVID 19,10.4103/ijoem.ijoem_49_20
1,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 60 days to 64 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 64 days standard deviation was 3 median was 5 ranges from 1 to 13 days Extreme estimation of incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection Conclusion This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID 19 of approximately 64 days Our findings support existing guidelines for 14 days of quarantine of persons potentially exposed to SARS CoV 2 Although for extreme cases the quarantine period should be extended up to three weeks,10.1101/2020.05.09.20096800
1,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,A study of early transmission dynamics of COVID 19 revealed that the mean incubation period was 5 days with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12 days A later study using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases showed a similar mean incubation period of 6 days An unusual case was also reported in which the incubation period was as long as 19 days Notably a long incubation time means adjustments in screening and control policies The 19 day incubation period is a low probability event and experts suggest 14 days for quarantine,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105955
1,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,It is common that for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised they have higher chance to be infected than others The estimated mean incubation period of SARS CoV 2 is 1 14 days mostly 3 7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan However a study on 1099 cases demonstrates that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days A more recent study as described above demonstrates that the incubation period was 4 days based on the demography of 8866 cases It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period thus preventing infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to others As a common practice individuals exposed to or infected by the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days,10.7150/ijbs.45134
0,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,The incubation period distribution is estimated from the nodes in with contact date information The distribution of the generation time is estimated from the edges in Figure 3 with contact date information for both the source and target nodes The results are shown in The best fit incubation period distribution is a gamma distribution with a mean 7 days and a variance 16 which correspond to a shape parameter 3 and a scale parameter 2 The generation time is estimated to be gamma distributed with a mean 3 days and a variance 3 corresponding to a shape parameter 4 and a scale parameter 1 Since the mean generation time is smaller than the mean incubation period on average a patient may become infectious 3 days before showing major symptoms shows the probability distribution of the fraction of individuals whose incubation period is longer than 14 21 and 22 days respectively On average a quarantine period of 14 days may lead to a failure rate of 6% ie 6% quarantined patients may show symptom after quarantine If we aim to control the failure rate of quarantine to be below 1% with 95% confidence then the quarantine period must be at least 22 days,10.1101/2020.02.26.20028431
1,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,The average incubation period for COVID 19 is reported to be 2 to 14 days and most patients show symptoms within 115 days To stop the spread of the disease public health officials in Hunan placed those who may have been from Wuhan and exposed to COVID 19 under quarantine for 14 days However the incubation period may be longer in some patients Here we report on the last COVID 19 familial cluster in Hunan province which was hospitalized on February 28 The disease was not confirmed until 40 days after the index patient had returned from Wuhan,10.1016/j.clim.2020.108413
1,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2 14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best fit lognormal distribution The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission for treatment and/or isolation was estimated at 3 4 days without truncation and at 5 9 days when right truncated Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death 17 days with right truncation should be considered when estimating the COVID 19 case fatality risk,10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754
1,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,undertook research into COVID 19 patients who were long term users of glucocorticoids Across the world clusters of patients having COVID 19 have been reported with research demonstrating that person toperson transmission is the chief route of infection The research states that average incubation periods are between 2 and 14 days with between 3 and 7 days being the most common The research notes that incubation periods may be extended in some patients The research reports on a family cluster of COVID 19 a 47 year old female member of the family on long term glucocorticoid therapy had no symptoms in a 14 day quarantine period but tested positive for COVID 19 antibodies 40 days after leaving Wuhan These findings imply that long term glucocorticoid use could be responsible for long incubation periods atypical infection and additional transmissions of the virus,10.1101/2020.05.20.20108340
0,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,Secondly the 22 March 2020 definition of a suspected case set by WHO occurs in a patient with any acute respiratory illness who has been in contact with a person with a case of confirmed or probable SARS CoV 2 in the last 14 days before onset of symptoms This definition is based on reports that calculated the incubation period to range from 1 to 14 days However recent reports have found that the incubation period might be as long as 24 days This period is much longer than the 14 days used by the WHO to guide quarantine policies so truly infected persons may be missed during the disease's long incubation period and they may contribute to the spread of SARS CoV 2,10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100672
1,quarantine is 14 days because incubation period is 2 to 14 days,When constructing intervention strategies for an epidemic the incubation period is an important parameter For example consider the quarantine strategy deployed in many countries during the early stages of the epidemic aimed at preventing cases being imported from Wuhan This strategy quarantined individuals upon their return from Wuhan for 14 days For such a strategy to be effective we require most incubation periods to be less than 14 days so that the majority of infected people would develop symptoms before quarantine ended enabling them to be further isolated In this analysis we show that in the worst case scenario we would expect 1 in 62 cases to slip through this quarantine with the best fit predicting 1 in 101 cases Therefore the 14 day quarantine period would capture the majority of cases Throughout the epidemic this seems to have been reasonably successful and prevented early seeding of cases in many countries However potentially due to complicated travel patterns or asymptomatic transmission cases have slipped through detection and not been quarantined which unfortunately has led to the situation observed today,
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,The WHO and the CDC recommend avoidance of nonessential travel to China Hong Kong Hanoi and Singapore Recently travel to Toronto has also again been discouraged Recent travelers to these areas who present with fever cough or dyspnea should be evaluated immediately and quarantined if indicated,10.1016/s0091-6749(04)70038-x
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,As of March 18 2020 Canada has implemented a ban on all foreign nationals entering Canada by air or marine and also imposed a 30 day restriction on all non essential travel at the Canada  US border The Government Travel advice and advisories warrants all persons to avoid all non  essential international travel including to United States with an aim to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID 19 in Canada In this context the Act/ Regulation came into force from 26 March 2020 which prohibits entry into Canada from US effective until 21 April 2020 and prohibition of entry into Canada from any country other than US until 30 June 2020 to support its continued focus on reducing the introduction and further spread of COVID 19,10.1186/s41256-020-00146-3
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,Social distancing involves taking deliberate steps to minimize close contact between people to limit COVID 19 transmission in the community Examples of social distancing measures include but are not limited to cancelling events and mass gatherings closing schools or switching to online learning working from home and reducing public services such as access to community centers Additionally many countries have begun advising their citizens to avoid all nonessential travel outside of the country as well as banning or severely limiting incoming international flights This seeks to limit the spread from countries with higher cases of COVID 19 to the resident country Finally an isolation from other individuals by a distance of 2 m or 6 feet in the United States is suggested,10.2106/jbjs.20.00396
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,World Health Organization continues to make recommendations against travel and trade restrictions for countries fighting with the COVID 19 pandemic Travel measures interfering significantly with international traffic can only be justified at the onset of a pandemic since countries may be allowed to rapidly implement preliminary measures even for a few days These kinds of restrictions should be based on meticulous risk assessment be proportional to public health risk not last long and be reevaluated regularly as the event advances Travel ban to affected regions or rejection of entry of passengers traveling from affected regions is not effective in preventing case imports but may have important economic and social impact Temperature scan at entry and exit points is not an efficient way to stop international spread since infected people may be within the incubation period and not show early symptoms during the disease For an adequate risk assessment and a follow of a probable case the patients should be provided with disease preventing messages health statements should be collected upon entry and contact information of the passengers should be obtained which would be much more efficient,10.3906/sag-2004-175
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,They should be visited restrictions at all facilities encouraging people to visit patients by a telephone or electronically We should also encourage people coming to the health care facilities for testing treatment to limit the number of people who accompanied them Since the virus causes significant mortality in older adults with significant comorbidities they should be more restrictions placed on nursing homes such as no visitor policies in a high risk environment We should encourage social distancing which means avoiding crowds and staying 6 feet away from other people as much as possible We should also cancel or postpone all nonessential community events All travel should be avoided unless absolutely necessary particularly to highly endemic zones of COVID 19 According to Wang et al those having had close contacts with infections are currently being asked to receive medical observation and quarantine for 14 days,10.14740/jocmr4142
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,At the present time airports harbors and ports road transportation and entry points to the country may have a critical role in the international transmission the diseases via persons goods and vehicles Therefore countries should be ready to detect and respond to any healthcare event that would cause international concern by bringing healthcare based restrictions in international travel and trade Thus developing necessary public health capacities in entry points of the country will limit the spread of public health hazards Particularly frequent travelers may have a part in accelerating the international spread of the virus during the early period of the pandemic Hence in the event of the onset of the pandemic being at a countryside where international travel is scarce the transmission of the agent to frequent travelers will be much late and the spread of the pandemic will be much slower,10.3906/sag-2004-175
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,University students may be under-immunised have frequent close interpersonal contact and may be unaware of increased risks of infection related to dormitory living all amplifying outbreak potential During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic it was reported that 60% of students were not aware that dormitory living posed an additional risk were not concerned about the pandemic not aware of their risks with only 21% adopting hand hygiene and 67% prepared to attend university with flu-like symptoms if they had an examination or assessment deadline In light of this it is important to ensure that international student travellers are aware of their infectious risks and undertake adequate travel health preparations and precautions in relation to their travel Therefore we aimed to better understanding the travel-related health risks pertaining to the Chinese international student population in Australia to inform the development of potential interventions to improve their travel health knowledge attitudes and practices,10.1016/j.idh.2020.03.002
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,Despite the unwavering international interest on this public health crisis information on biology and transmission of this virus are limited and final mortality rates are subject to only rough estimation Interestingly there are varying approaches in different countries on how to best avoid further COVID 19 exposure from outside While new data is acquired amid these discussions some countries have restricted travel to regions with high amounts of COVID 19 cases So far a wide range of distinct operational procedures and measures have been implemented with respect to air traffic While some countries have completely shut down border crossings and restricted flights in affected areas others have implemented fever measurements and 2 week long self quarantine for travelers to contain further spread of COVID 19 cases Since the extent of COVID 19 cases vary enormously between different countries ranging from very high numbers to none or only a few cases making decisions on if and how to restrict air traffic from heavily affected countries remains challenging The united effort of all countries to decrease the speed of COVID 19 spread and reduce undetected cases from traveling into their respective countries5 further adds to this challenge,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.026
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,Nonetheless during a pandemic like the one we live in at the moment you have to pay attention to the messages from local authorities since they may impose further measures like strict stay at home and no gather for the control of pandemic Furthermore measures of personal and environmental hygiene as well as most of the behavioral restrictions social distancing frequent and proper hand washing avoiding gathering  keeping surfaces clean and disinfected and not touching your face when your hands are not washed should be in any case adopted Ask your doctor!  During the pandemic avoid non essential international travel and sea cruises even they are permitted in your country and stay at home! This will help in the control of COVID 19 outbreak and will reduce your risk of exposure Note that in some countries you can contact local authorities to be informed about the any specific measures you should follow when you visit the country,10.1016/s1470-2045(20)30278-3
1,Travelers should avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic,Those who traveled from China or other countries and exhibited symptoms including fever difficulty in breathing sore throat cough and breathlessness were asked to visit the nearest hospital for a health check up Officials from seven different airports including Chennai Cochin New Delhi Kolkata Hyderabad and Bengaluru have been ordered to screen and monitor Indian travelers from China and other affected countries In addition a travel advisory was released to request the cessation of travel to affected countries and anyone with a travel history that has included China since January 15th 2020 would be quarantined A centralized control room has been set up by the Delhi government at the Directorate General of Health Services and 11 other districts have done the same India has implemented COVID 19 travel advisory for intra  and inter passenger aircraft restrictions,10.3389/fmed.2020.00250
1,It is unknown if babies can get the virus before birth,As shown 322 offspring of Covid-19 mothers were tested after birth and 10 were noted to be positive 3% It is not possible however to know when and by which route prenatal perinatal like herpes simplex or postnatal the virus passed to the neonate as few samples were reported to have been obtained immediately after birth or was sampling done serially In addition it is not clear if the infants who tested positive were separated from their mothers beginning immediately after birth so it is not possible to determine if these were cases of postnatally acquired virus,10.1016/j.prrv.2020.06.006
1,It is unknown if babies can get the virus before birth,There is no reported transmission during birth Infants born vaginally or by caesarean section to mothers with coronavirus infection have so far been shown to be negative to COVID 19 This is based on an observational study of 4 mothers infected with COVID 19 and 3 newborns a single case report and an observational study on 11 mothers infected with COVID 19 and their newborns,10.1101/2020.03.30.20047969
1,It is unknown if babies can get the virus before birth,On the other hand an initial case report from China described elevated IgG and IgM against SARS CoV 2 drawn at 2 hours of age born to a mother with Covid 19 However the baby had 5 negative RT PCR nasopharyngeal tests In another study of six infants born to Covid 19 mothers who had blood and nasopharyngeal samples obtained at birth two had elevations in their IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS CoV 2 although neither had viral RNA detected These results taken together raise the possibility that the fetus responds with an immune response to virus at some point prior to delivery but they need to be confirmed by larger more systematic studies using validated serological assays are required to establish the true nature of the associations between SARS CoV 2 and neonatal infections,10.1016/j.prrv.2020.06.006
1,It is unknown if babies can get the virus before birth,In this study four pregnant women were confirmed to have the COVID 19 infection One mother experienced reduced fetal movement One mother developed anemia and dyspnea after admission Of the three infants whose parents provided consent to be diagnostically tested none tested positive for the virus None of the infants developed serious clinical symptoms such as fever cough or diarrhea Two newborns had a rash which disappeared spontaneously without treatment; one newborn had mild dyspnea and was considered to suffer from TTN and supported by non invasive mechanical ventilation for 3 days All of the four babies are doing well and have been formula feeding since birth,10.3389/fped.2020.00104
1,It is unknown if babies can get the virus before birth,However five throat swabs of the neonate for PCR from 2 h until 16 days post birth were performed to prove infection and were negative for COVID 19 Amniotic fluid cord blood or placenta were not tested Based on these findings intrauterine infection seems unlikely and the IgG antibodies were most likely of maternal origin The IgM result can be false positive as seen before in cases of cytomegalovirus infection,10.3390/diagnostics10040243
1,It is unknown if babies can get the virus before birth,A recently reported single case of a neonate that tested positive for COVID 19 does not provide definitive evidence of intrauterine or intrapartum infection as no intrauterine tissue sample was tested and the neonate was tested 30 hours after birth However this case does suggest that cross infection can occur at some point between pregnancy and the early postnatal period,10.1101/2020.03.30.20047969
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio NLR and systematic immune inflammation based prognostic index SII were significantly higher on admission in severe critical pneumonia group than moderate pneumonia group Amniotic fluid placenta neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples were tested for SARS CoV 2 by RT PCR and all results were negative,10.1101/2020.04.07.20053744
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,Findings Compared with non pregnant women pregnant women had a significantly lower proportion of fever a shorter average interval from onset to hospitalization and a higher proportion of severe or critical COVID 19 Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio NLR and systematic immune inflammation based prognostic index SII were significantly higher on admission in severe critical pneumonia group than moderate pneumonia group We could not detect the presence of SARS CoV 2 by RT PCR in amniotic fluid placenta neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples Conclusions The clinical symptoms of COVID 19 in pregnant women were insidious and atypical compared with those in non pregnant patients SII and NLR could be a useful marker to evaluate the severity of COVID 19 There was no evidence of vertical transmission during pregnancy with SARS CoV 2 infection,10.1101/2020.04.07.20053744
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,Another focus of this study was to evaluate the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID 19 We did not find evidence of SARS CoV 2 by RT PCR in breastmilk amniotic fluid placenta neonatal throat swab and neonatal anal swab These findings suggested that SARS CoV 2 could not penetrate the placental and blood milk barriers This observation confirms 5 premature delivery and 12 full term,10.1101/2020.04.07.20053744
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,There remain unanswered questions concerning mother to child transmission MTCT of SARS CoV 2 Despite reports of neonatal COVID 19 SARS CoV 2 has not been consistently isolated in perinatal samples thus definitive proof of transplacental infection is still lacking To address these questions we assessed investigative tools used to confirm maternal fetal infection and known protective mechanisms of the placental barrier that prevent transplacental pathogen migration Forty studies of COVID 19 pregnancies reviewed suggest a lack of consensus on diagnostic strategy for congenital infection While RT PCR of neonatal swabs was universally performed a wide range of clinical samples was screened including vaginal secretions amniotic fluid breast milk and umbilical cord blood Neonatal COVID 19 was reported in eight studies two of which were based on the detection of SARS CoV 2 IgM in neonatal blood Histological examination demonstrated sparse viral particles vascular malperfusion and inflammation in the placenta from pregnant women with COVID 19 The paucity of placental co expression of ACE 2 and TMPRSS2 two receptors involved in cytoplasmic entry of SARS CoV 2 may explain its relative insensitivity to transplacental infection Viral interactions may utilise membrane receptors other than ACE 2 thus tissue susceptibility may be broader than currently known,10.1002/pd.5765
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,Whether COVID 19 can be transmitted through breastmilk is unknown We are aware of a single report of SARS CoV testing of breastmilk in a mother who had recovered from SARS and no viral RNA was detected; however the specimen was collected 130 days after illness onset SARS CoV antibodies were seen in breastmilk of that patient15 but not in another patient who was infected at 7 weeks gestation with breastmilk tested at postpartum days and Breastmilk was tested for SARS CoV 2 in 6 of the mothers reported by Chen all specimens were negative,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.017
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,Indeed SARS CoV 2 was recently detected in the urine tears and conjunctival secretions in SARS CoV 2 patients Several lines of evidence suggested that the vagina can be infected by HCoV 229E confirming the role of the sexual route in the transmission of the HCoV 229E virus Unexpectedly a more recent study by Cui found that ACE2 receptor is not expressed in the vagina and cervix tissues They pointed out that the pregnant SARS CoV 2 patients do not have SARS CoV 2 in their vaginal discharge hence SARS CoV 2 cannot be transmitted during the delivery More specifically SARS CoV 2 is absent in the cord blood neonatal throat swab breastmilk and amniotic fluid Although this evidence confirmed the impossibility of vertical transmission of the SARS CoV 2 virus a recent study published by another group showed that the fetal liver is an organ that can be infected by SARS CoV 2 during pregnancy because of the up regulation of the ACE2 receptor expression,10.1186/s13020-020-00337-7
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,Children seem less vulnerable to SARS CoV 2 infection and when COVID 19 develops in children it seems milder compared to in adult patients It has been hypothesized that children are less susceptible because they may be protected by some antibodies against other coronaviruses or they do not develop a strong inflammatory reaction which is partially responsible for the lung injury during COVID 19 Newborns do not have antibodies against other coronaviruses so theoretically they maybe more vulnerable to SARS CoV 2 infection In our research none of the samples from different body part of the neonates maternal amniotic fluid and breast milk were detected for SARS CoV 2 positive None of the 19 neonates developed clinical radiologic hematologic or biochemical evidence of COVID 19 This results are partially consistent with Chen study which showed 9 SARS CoV 2 infected pregnant women do not seem to develop a more severe COVID 19 compared to nonpregnant patients and the consequence of their neonates were relatively well,10.1007/s11684-020-0772-y
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,Nearly 90% of children with COVID 19 were believed to have been infected via close contact with family members or community exposure Current data indicate that infected children are not themselves a major source of transmission This is in contrast to influenza where children have played an important role in the transmission to household contacts and are important drivers of epidemics in the community A very limited number of infections have been reported in infants and neonates At the present time there is no evidence that SARS CoV 2 is transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy Moreover although the virus may be transmitted during birth or very shortly thereafter this is unusual There is also currently no evidence that the virus is teratogenic although because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester when embryogenesis occurs a risk of congenital anomalies associated with COVID 19 cannot be completely excluded Data and prior experience with other respiratory viruses eg influenza SARS CoV 1 MERS suggest that antenatal transplacental transmission via maternal viremia is unlikely,10.1016/j.ijpam.2020.05.001
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,Chen analyzed 9 pregnant women who had been diagnosed with COVID 19 in their third trimester and had caesarean section Clinical features of mothers and their newborns were recorded along with SARS CoV 2 detection in amniotic fluid cord blood breastmilk and nasopharyngeal swab of the newborn None of the 9 mothers developed severe pneumonia died or had miscarriage All the amniotic fluid cord blood breastmilk and nasopharyngeal swab of the newborn tested negative for SARS CoV 2 This study suggested that there is currently no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS CoV 2 in women who developed pneumonia during 3rd trimester of pregnancy However the number of pregnant women of the study is very small and only the infection in the late of pregnancy is included so it cannot be concluded at the moment on the impact of the infection especially in the early or mid term pregnancy on pregnant women and fetuses,10.3345/cep.2020.00493
1,COVID has not been detected in amniotic fluid breastmilk or other maternal samples,The presence of SARS CoV 2 was tested in amniotic fluid cord blood neonatal throat swab and breastmilk samples collected from six patients Neither the Kit recommended by CDC nor our in house nested RT PCR assays detected SARS CoV 2 in these samples,10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30360-3
0,If you are sick with COVID-19 you can not breastfeed,Women with COVID 19 can breastfeed Moreover our case also highlights how telemedicine plays a very important role in supporting patients confined at home during the coronavirus pandemic emergency,10.1111/ijd.14919
1,If you are sick with COVID-19 you can not breastfeed,Pharyngeal swab specimen was collected immediately from the infant 36 hours after birth along with the breast milk of the mother We recommended the mother not to breastfeed and empty the breast milk to avoid mastitis,10.1093/cid/ciaa225
0,If you are sick with COVID-19 you can not breastfeed,The document on COVID 19 and breastfeeding developed by the WHO Regional Office for Europe strongly supports the continuation of this practice during COVID 19 which is key for ensuring the health of children EPA UNEPSA on behalf of its National European pediatric societies and associations strongly and actively collaborates with the WHO regional office in promoting the position that breast milk is the ideal food for infants as it is safe clean and provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life Breast milk contains antibodies which help protect children against many common childhood illnesses and breastfeeding confers many short and long term health benefits for both the mother and child Efforts should be made to properly advise and support mothers with breastfeeding even in instances when the mother has confirmed or suspected COVID 19 infection If clinical conditions prevent to breastfeed or express breastmilk explore the possibility to practice relactation restarting breastfeeding after a gap or using donor human milk though certified donor milk banking,10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.05.009
0,If you are sick with COVID-19 you can not breastfeed,Given the lack of data on vertical transmission guidance on breastfeeding is difficult We note that guidance from China is that Infants should not be fed with the breast milk from mothers with confirmed or suspected of 2019 nCoV Guidance from the CDC is less clear but suggests being precautionary In the current state of knowledge we recommend that mothers with proven infection and who are symptomatic suggestive of high viral load should not breastfeed babies with unknown status currently If these mothers wish to breastfeed in the future they should express milk and discard it and resume breastfeeding once confirmed as non infective In less severe cases we recommend that whether to start or continue breastfeeding should be determined by the mother in coordination with her family and healthcare providers We recommend that human breast milk banks should not use human milk from mothers confirmed to be infected with COVID 19,10.1101/2020.03.06.20032144
0,If you are sick with COVID-19 you can not breastfeed,Careful collection techniques should be used for pumped breast milk including providing mothers with a dedicated breast pump Mothers should wash their hands before and after pumping and the breast pump should be properly disinfected per the manufacturerâs instructions If possible expressed breast milk should be fed to newborns by a healthy caregiver If a mother with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 chooses to directly breastfeed she should wear a surgical mask and perform hand and breast hygiene prior to feeding When the mother is not breastfeeding the newborn should remain 2 m away be separated by a barrier and or be placed in an isolette The World Health Organization and United Nations Children Fund recommend standard breastfeeding guidelines within an hour of birth using appropriate infection prevention precautions This advice may be most pertinent to areas where limited resources make breastfeeding the only viable option,10.1038/s41372-020-0695-0
1,If you are sick with COVID-19 you can not breastfeed,Close attention must be paid to the hygiene of hands and breasts during breastfeeding Suspected cases uncured clinically diagnosed cases and uncured confirmed cases are not recommended to breastfeed Lopinavir/ritonavir can be secreted with the milk of rats but it is uncertain whether the breast milk in human contains ingredients of the drug Therefore breastfeeding is not suggested while taking this medicine During the suspension of breastfeeding it is advised that the mother empties her breasts regularly,10.1007/s11596-020-2174-4
0,If you are sick with COVID-19 you can not breastfeed,Women with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 infection are encouraged to breastfeed in absence of other limitations However precautions should be taken to minimize potential problems Roomsharing and uninterrupted mother infant proximity is recommended as an important factor for establishing good breastfeeding also for mothers with COVID 19 providing that specific and appropriate respiratory and skin hygiene measures are taken If mothers are unable to breastfeed due to severe health conditions caused by COVID 19 they should receive support from competent health care professionals They may be advised to provide breast milk to their infants via safe alternative methods such as the provision of expressed milk or relactation the process of restarting breastfeeding after a gap or very little breastfeeding If that is not possible other alternatives can be considered such as the use of certified donor milk bank services designed to protect the incoming milk supply by rigorous screening criteria for milk donors,10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.05.009
1,The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water,SARS CoV2 is an RNA virus that is wrapped with a fragile external lipid membrane In general wrapped viruses are less stable in the environment and are more susceptible to oxidizers such as chlorine Persistence of coronaviruses on surfaces shows great variability ranging from about 2 hours to 9 days Survival time depends on different factors such as surface type temperature relative humidity and the specific strain of the virus World Health Organization 2020 The SARS CoV2 could be eliminated within 1 minute using common disinfectants such as 70% ethanol or sodium hypochlorite COVID 19 has not yet been detected in drinking water supplies and based on current evidence the risk of infection from water supplies is low,10.1016/j.clinph.2020.04.011
0,The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water,Evidence has been published on the presence of human pathogenic viruses in treated water since drinking water treatment processes may have a limited capacity for virus reduction Infectious rotavirus and enterovirus were detected in 83% of treated drinking water samples associated with rainfall but not with the presence of bacterial indicators In the African region using cell culture reported the presence of cultivable enteroviruses in 7 out of 30 finished drinking water samples at concentrations ranging from 5 to 33 plaque forming units per litre In Asian and African countries integrated cell culture PCR enabled the detection of enteroviruses adenoviruses or both in drinking water With the use of only molecular methods the presence of several pathogenic viruses such as rotavirus astrovirus and NoV were detected in drinking water in European African and Asian countries In another study in Thailand no HAV was detected in tap waters but in Brazil 20% of river and tap waters were HAV positive In Canada outbreaks were identified associated with the presence of HAV and NoV in drinking water,10.1016/s0168-7069(07)17007-5
0,The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water,Viruses are the important pathogens often detected in drinking water leading to numbers of severe human diseases Because of resistance application of chemical processes such as chlorination has been found to have no profound effect on most of the viruses as compared to pathogenic bacteria calling for the need of membrane based technologies The development of membrane based filtration technology has gained considerable success to eliminate their presence in potable water Studies conducted on removal of virus based on NF technology have demonstrated promising results Because the smaller sized virus particles of coliphage Q as model virus may traverse the NF membrane the elimination of particular viruses could not be expected to be the only outcome of pore size The passage of smaller virus particles was expected to result from exceptionally larger membrane pores not considered for porosity evaluation,10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00021-9
0,The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water,The presence of the virus in the wastewater even when the prevalence of the virus is low indicates that the SARS CoV 2 can survive in the sewage This finding could be a sensitive tool for tracking and monitoring the rate of virus rotation in communities Some studies have reported that coronavirus can remain in water or wastewater sources for days or weeks Due to the evidence of the virus surviving in aquatic and sewage environments its presence in water resources is dependent on essential factors such as temperature sunlight and the presence of organic compounds that the virus can adsorb to and protect themself against sunlight The presence of other antagonistic microorganisms can also affect its survival in water resources According to the latest WHO report there is no evidence that human type coronavirus has been transmitted through contaminated drinking water In general coated viruses are less environmentally friendly and are more sensitive to oxidants such as chlorine The SARS CoV 2 is likely to be significantly inactivated more rapidly than human intestinal viruses without water borne diseases in contact with oxidants,10.1186/s13568-020-01028-0
1,The virus in stool is infectious,The SARS CoV is a newly discovered virus Thus far there have only been a few reports of its survival characteristics Here we demonstrate that this deadly virus can remain infectious for a long period in stool specimens The samples that we spiked with SARS CoV were incubated in closed containers during the entire period of incubation simulating the conditions in a sewage drainage pipe Thus our results showed that in this situation droplets may be a concern with regard to disease transmission as occurred in the Amoy Gardens outbreaks This has significant implications for sewage treatment in both domestic and hospital environments Fortunately this virus is also susceptible to drying We showed that when virus containing droplets were dried the virus was inactivated rapidly on paper and cotton cloth Transmission through droplet contaminated paper and cotton gowns is unlikely and common household detergents can be effective decontaminating agents for use in the laboratory and hospital,10.1086/433186
0,The virus in stool is infectious,Data are lacking regarding other routes of sexual transmission Two small studies of SARS CoV 2âinfected people did not detect virus in semen or vaginal secretions An additional study of semen samples from 38 patients detected the virus by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 6 patients However the relevance regarding sexual transmission remains unknown Until this is better understood it would be prudent to consider semen potentially infectious Although 1 study failed to detect the virus in urine samples there is evidence that SARS CoV 2 nucleic acids were detected in a urine sample in at least 1 patient in another study Until this is clarified urine should also be considered potentially infectious SARS CoV 2 RNA has been detected in stool samples raising concern for fecalâoral transmission It is not clear however whether viral RNA detected in stool is capable of causing productive infection Moreover these data are moot given that any in person contact results in substantial risk for disease transmission owing to the virus stability on common surfaces and propensity to propagate in the oropharynx and respiratory tract,10.7326/m20-2004
1,The virus in stool is infectious,The present study demonstrates that SARS CoV can survive in respiratory samples for 5 days at room temperature and for up to 3 weeks at 4 C Although normal fecal material seems to have a deleterious effect on its survival the present study shows that the virus could have a prolonged survival when present in diarrheal stool The virus can survive for 4 days at room temperature after being spiked in diarrheal stool with an alkaline pH This observation lends evidence that fecal droplets containing SARS CoV remain infectious for a period of time This may explain the Amoy Gardens outbreaks in which the drainage and sewage system was implicated in facilitating the spread of SARS as was pointed out in the SARS Expert Committee study and in a simulation study by Yu et al,10.1086/433186
1,The virus in stool is infectious,Test of SARS CoV 2 virus in stool was found to be positive even after a negative throat swab test in 42% 81% of cases In addition stool samples can remain positive for up to day 16 of illness These findings raise the question regarding the need for longer isolation and stool viral testing after clinical recovery This is especially concerning in relation to a recent study that demonstrated SARS CoV 2 virus isolated from stool is infectious manuscript in preparation Pathogen host and environment factors influencing the fecal oral transmissibility of SARS CoV 2 are illustrated It is important to note here that presence of COVID 19 nucleic acid in stool has been reported as not correlated with severity of pneumonia or GI manifestation On the other hand shedding of viral RNA in stool has provided an opportunity to develop stool based diagnostic test for SARS CoV 2 infection A study by Zhang and colleagues demonstrated equal accuracy in COVID 19 detection by using stool specimens compared to pharyngeal swab specimens This finding can potentially lead to development of a less invasive COVID 19 diagnostic test,10.3748/wjg.v26.i19.2323
1,The virus in stool is infectious,Fecal transmission is another unanswered question about COVID 19 Presence of patients with diarrhea finding of fecal samples positive for SARS CoV by RT PCR and detection of live virus in stool at least one study suggest that stool is infectious even though it has not been verified by other studies Detection of SARS CoV 2 RNA in patients fecal samples with negative respiratory tract samples for a mean of 11 days might be important Even if gastrointestinal involvement or digested sputum was the origin of virus existence in the stool this fact gives another reason to emphasize good personal hygiene Possibility of fecal transmission remains unanswered until viable virus is detected in stool samples and new data is available to prove oral fecal transmission which affect procedures for quarantine hospitalization and self isolation practices,10.3906/sag-2004-172
1,The virus in stool is infectious,In conclusion in this study we showed that the simultaneous detection of influenza and enteric viruses is not a rare event We have also reported for the first time in general practice the presence of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting for uncomplicated AD This result could support the idea that the influenza virus could on some occasions be a responsible cause of gastroenteritis given the presence among some patients of diarrhea and the absence of any respiratory symptoms along with the absence of co pathogens in 50% of them More focused screening of fecal samples for the detection and isolation of influenza viruses in patients presenting with gastroenteritis will be required to demonstrate this additional potential disease association The possible presence of infectious influenza viruses in fecal samples could create problems concerning infection control and highlights the importance of contact precaution when handling stools Whereas influenza viruses are usually regarded to spread via direct contact with respiratory droplets the possible fecalâoral transmission of influenza viruses has to be elucidated,10.1186/1743-422x-9-116
1,The virus in stool is infectious,Guaranteeing safe water collecting sewage and maintaining effective hygiene during infectious diseases including COVID 19 pandemic play a key role in supporting human health The risk of COVID 19 appears to be low through the stool of an infected person There is evidence that SARS CoV 2 may lead to intestinal infection and be present in the stool Studies show that approximately 2 to 10 percent of confirmed SARS CoV 2 cases have been associated with diarrhea Two studies have reported the detection of residual SARS CoV 2 viral RNA in the stool of patients with SARS CoV 2 Yet only one study has reported the SARS CoV 2 from a cultured stool sample In the latest study the report of the presence of the SARS CoV 2 virus in sewage has been confirmed,10.1186/s13568-020-01028-0
0,The virus in stool is infectious,It is worth noting that only throat swab specimens were used for viral RNA detection since this is a retrospective study Evidence has shown that SARS CoV 2 could be detected in stool samples as well However a recent study declared that infectious virus was predominantly derived from the respiratory tract and not from stools One limitation of our work is that we detected virus by rRT PCR but not by virus isolation As rRT PCR detects both viable and nonviable virus more convincible studies are needed to investigate whether people with just persistent positive rRT PCR results are transmissible or not,10.1183/13993003.01190-2020
0,COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools or hot tubs,In order to carry out this innovative strategy it is necessary to share international recommendations combining the therapeutic requires with measures to prevent the spread of the infection In particular a prolonged interaction between the patients and the staff and the possible need of involving family members in the delivery of care must be considered Internationally it seems that the access of patients family members and staff should be considered safe respecting hygienic procedures such as limiting close contact using personal protective equipment and encouraging to wash hands often It is also recommended to train staff and patients to health education and preventive measures Concerning the water there is no evidence that COVID 19 can spread to people through the water used in pools hot tubs and spas and a proper disinfection should kill the virus The access to Health resort medicine should be guaranteed to post COVID 19 subjects after two negative rRT PCR results improvement in signs and symptoms and fever resolution,10.1007/s00484-020-01947-4
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,The course of COVID 19 in children can be characterized by mild illness and no symptoms According to a study by the Chinese CDC as of February 11 2020 81% of all patients with COVID 19 showed only mild symptoms However although the disease was less severe in the majority of adults 51% 74% 26% 32% of adults were still committed to ICU and had often basic diseases such as hypertension or diabetes In contrast we found only 3% report of children with severe illness,10.1101/2020.04.13.20064352
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,COVID 19 appears to be relatively rare in children and children seem to present less severe symptoms compared to adults However the COVID 19 infection can occur in children via intrafamilial transmission if the virus spreads within the family through infected adults The first pediatric case of COVID 19 occurred in Korea on 18 February 2020 involving a 10 year old girl who had close contact with her uncle and mother who were both diagnosed with COVID 19 Most of the COVID 19 infection cases in children were found among family clusters as a result of close contact with other COVID 19 cases While in self quarantine infants and young children must be taken care of by their caregivers; self isolation of young children by themselves is almost impossible Although most of the infected children had mild or difficult to recognize symptoms at present there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines against the COVID 19 infection Understandably families with young children are anxious and concerned about the transmission of COVID 19,10.3390/ijerph17103723
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,Pandemic coronavirus COVID 19 is a novel virus that causes severe pneumonia Elderly people with co morbidities are at risk of severe disease Symptoms are generally milder in children We present an asthmatic 12 year old girl with cough wheeze and mild pneumonia due to COVID 19 Reverse transcription RT polymerase chain reaction PCR confirmed COVID 19 on nasopharyngeal sample Chest radiograph revealed bronchopneumonia Frequent salbutamol inhalers were administered for treatment Case was discharged home 2 days following hospitalization COVID 19 may present with mild pneumonia in children or with an exacerbation of asthma in asthmatic children Additional observations of clinical presentations of COVID 19 in children are recommended,10.1007/s42399-020-00310-3
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,Previously healthy children with COVID 19 have mild symptoms The diagnosis is generally suspected from history of household exposure to COVID 19 case Children with COVID 19 and major underlying condition are more likely to have severe critical disease and poor prognosis even death,10.1002/ppul.24869
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,Children with COVID 19 are more common to have only mild symptoms and many children are even completely asymptomatic Fever and cough are the main symptoms of COVID 19 in both children Vomiting and diarrhea occurring less frequently in children,10.1101/2020.04.13.20064352
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,Different age group are generally susceptible to SARS CoV 2 estimated that the basic reproduction number R0 value is 2 Since December 2019 there have been COVID 19 confirmed cases in all provinces and cities nationwide in China and in many other countries As of 6 February 2020 at least 230 COVID 19 cases in children have been reported in China suggesting that the SARS CoV 2 has a strong transmission capacity in the special population ie neonate and children The present study indicates that infected preschool children have different clinical symptoms and CT imaging findings from those of adults Symptoms may not be apparent in young children Under the current epidemic conditions cluster outbreaks in families have occurred If children especially preschool children are not paid attention to they may contribute to the spread of infection and may not be treated in a timely manner,10.1186/s12887-020-02140-7
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 has caused a global pandemic All people including children are generally susceptible to COVID 19 but the condition is relatively mild for children The diagnosis of COVID 19 is largely based on the epidemiological evidence and clinical manifestations and confirmed by positive detection of virus nucleic acid in respiratory samples The main symptoms of COVID 19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections Early identification early isolation early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID 19 is mainly symptomatic For severe and critical ill cases the oxygen therapy antiviral drugs antibacterial drugs glucocorticoids mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO may be adopted and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi disciplinary cooperation,
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,According to the available data COVID 19 in children appears to be usually mild A minority of children with COVID 19 require hospitalization By March 6 among 2572 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID 19 in children reported from the US the estimated rate of hospitalization differed from 6% to 20% and of them were admitted to an ICU6 In this report children aged 1 year had the highest percentage 15% 62% of hospitalization among pediatric patients with COVID 19 Among 95 children aged 1 year with known hospitalization status 59 62% were hospitalized including five who were admitted to an ICU The percentage of patients hospitalized among those aged 1 17 years was lower  with little variation among age group,10.3906/sag-2004-174
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,There is only limited data detailing the effects of COVID 19 on the pediatric population A review of 72314 cases by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that <1% of COVID 19 cases were in children younger than 10 years old Based on a single epidemiological study of 2143 pediatric patients evaluated and treated for COVID 19 there were 731 cases confirmed via RT PCR testing Children of all ages were infected with the median age being 7 years range 1 day to 18 years 56% of the infected pediatric patients were male Compared to adult patients children diagnosed with COVID 19 seem to have less severe disease Over 90% of the cases were mild or moderate in nature Young children especially infants however seemed to be more susceptible to severe disease than older children; 10% of patients under 1 year of age had severe or critical disease The only death in the series was a 14 year old male,10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.063
1,Children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms,Most of the children 78% were asymptomatic and only 5% of asymptomatic children developed clinical symptoms such as dyspnea or hypoxia and 0.6% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS or multi organ failure Also all articles stated that based on existing knowledge the childhood illness is much less severe than that of adults and its cause is unknown In this regard we assessed underlying diseases of children but most of them did not have any underlying disease 42% and some studies did not state if underlying illnesses were present or not 57% Studies have also shown that lower respiratory tract involvement is rarely seen in children and most of them have upper respiratory tract involvement Most of the reported cases had improved within 1 to 2 weeks and were discharged from the hospital 99% however some remained under treatment or had died According to articles two children had died One of them was a 14 year old boy who lived in Hubei province but no information was provided about his exposure history underlying disease or comorbidity,
0,COVID-19 is just like the flu,Although initially considered another flu illness the new Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID 19 infection has morphed into a global pandemic the likes of which we have not seen in recent times Fundamentally regarded as a respiratory illness and caused by the coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 it is spread as an airborne infection COVID 19 has been shown to be a highly infectious disease As a new virus and with the world's population lacking any immunity to the virus COVID 19 has now spread like wildfire throughout the world,10.1002/jgh3.12364
0,COVID-19 is just like the flu,Typically COVID 19 triggers flu like symptoms such as fever and cough These symptoms can develop into pneumonia chest strain chest pain and difficulty to breath in elderly people and other patients who have other chronic health conditions It looks like it begins with a fever and leads to dry coughing One week after infection the conditions become harsh and lead to breath shortening with approximately 20% of patients requiring hospital treatment and medication The COVID 19 illness appears to seldom induce runny nose sneezing or sore throat only around 5% of patients have such symptoms Painful throat sneezing and stuffy nose are typically symptoms of seasonal flu or cold A few patients may develop pain or hemoptysis and many may also be completely asymptomatic Older people with comorbidity and serious alveolar injury are more prone to experience respiratory failure,10.15190/d.2020.5
0,COVID-19 is just like the flu,Firstly it broke out in the flu season with similar main symptoms related to the respiratory tract Both COVID 19 and influenza are characterized by typical chest CT presentation of ground glass opacity and consolidation and pathological features of diffuse alveolar damage DAD Moreover more than 80% of COVID 19 cases are mild or even asymptomatic 2  As we all know other types of human coronavirus can also lead to influenza like illness All these may have given people a false impression that this emerging disease is just one new subtype of influenza caused by SARS COV 2,10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa015
0,COVID-19 is just like the flu,However my plans changed with the Covid 19 outbreak in China When the disease started I thought it was just like any type of flu outbreak But as the month of January progressed the situation became serious and death toll started to increase News reports on the number of affected cases and the death rate got me panicked and worried Covid 19 was labeled a dangerous disease without a cure at the time scientists were not even sure about its mode of transmission Numbers of infected cases kept swelling every day and the death toll skyrocketed I was left wondering why me? Others who came before me studied successfully and returned home with no stigma but I was caught in the middle of the outbreak To make matters worse the university imposed a lockdown on students living on campus and prevented us from even visiting our country mates in other dormitories on the same campus This move drowned my hope and academic energy and replaced them with fear and stress,10.1007/s42438-020-00128-1
0,COVID-19 is just like the flu,The infection from the COVID-19 virus produces flu symptoms in most cases with an asymptomatic but potentially infecting phase Regardless of that the natural history of this disease can be modeled in principle as to SIR or SIRS compartmental models For the present times in which the pandemic is just starting and before there is evidence supporting the possibility of reinfection we assume a SIR model to describe the dynamics of the local spreading for every country,10.1101/2020.03.19.20037192
0,COVID-19 is just like the flu,Although COVID 19 may present mildly as a flu like disease or even be asymptomatic some patients develop significant cardiovascular and other adverse effects According to present data 81% of infected individuals have only mild flu like symptoms and recover within two weeks 14% have severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and 5% become critically ill15 These differences in presentation are thought to be due to viral load age and the presence of comorbidities12 As many carriers may be asymptomatic and an underestimated source of transmission13 effective screening and contact tracing are important to identify high risk individuals advise self isolation where transmission risk is high and trace possible cases to limit community spread Children may also be possible carriers of asymptomatic infection Lu described that children under 10 years old may be asymptomatic,10.1177/0004563220928361

1,It is possible to have COVID-19 with minimal or even no symptoms at all,COVID 19 is a viral disease that can affect every age group from infants to the elderly resulting in a wide spectrum of various clinical manifestations COVID 19 might present different degrees of severity from mild or even asymptomatic carriers even to fatal cases The most common complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome Fever dry cough muscle weakness and chest pain are the most prevalent and typical symptoms of COVID 19 However patients might also present atypical symptoms that can occur alone which might indicate the possible SARS CoV 2 infection The aim of this paper is to review and summarize all of the findings regarding clinical manifestations of COVID 19 patients which include respiratory neurological olfactory and gustatory gastrointestinal ophthalmic dermatological cardiac and rheumatologic manifestations as well as specific symptoms in pediatric patients,10.3390/jcm9061753
1,It is possible to have COVID-19 with minimal or even no symptoms at all,Patients infected by the coronavirus take some time incubation period of 5 days before they show any symptoms During this asymptomatic pre symptomatic phase they are assumed infective a few days prior ~24 to 48 hours prior to the onset of symptoms Symptomatic individuals may recover after a mild illness or become serious and require hospitalisation Serious patients may recover or can become critical requiring ventilator  ICU facilities The critical patients can recover or unfortunately die,
1,It is possible to have COVID-19 with minimal or even no symptoms at all,Contrast with other Coronavirus ie SARS and MERS one essential different feature of COVID 19 is the asymptomatic infection At the beginning of the spread of this virus there were already several experts point out this Many researchers prove the existence of asymptomatic COVID 19 carriers by comparing the nucleic acid testing of patients pharyngeal swab samples and chest CT scans with their typical symptoms and Li mention that more young carriers show mild symptoms than older patients Compared with retired people young adult have more social activities in general Include the asymptomatic carriers into an epidemic model is crucial About the proportion of asymptomatic patients among all viral carrier many experts provide their own estimation based on distinct data source,
1,It is possible to have COVID-19 with minimal or even no symptoms at all,Asymptomatic transmission of COVID 19 has been documented The viral loads of asymptomatic carriers are similar to those in symptomatic carriers A recent study concluded that asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers may have the same level of infectiousness These findings demand a reassessment of the transmission dynamics of the COVID 19 outbreak that better account for asymptomatic transmission,10.1101/2020.03.18.20037994
1,It is possible to have COVID-19 with minimal or even no symptoms at all,Our study also showed there were significantly more asymptomatic carriers in the pediatric COVID 19 group but none in the paediatric SARS group This finding was consistent with studies in adults with SARS which found only a few asymptomatic adults or healthcare workers who tested antibodypositive after the epidemic or had only mild and self limiting symptoms To the contrary asymptomatic COVID 19 infections were reported to be common among adults and younger adults without co morbidities Asymptomatic transmission of SARS CoV 2 may be one of the key factors leading to the pandemic In our study the average time to achieve a negative NPA and hospital LOS were similar for symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID 19 patients which indicates that clearance of COVID 19 virus may be similar for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients,10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.06.041
1,It is possible to have COVID-19 with minimal or even no symptoms at all,As much as one fifth of individuals with COVID 19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID 19 but fever was not Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.04.040
1,It is possible to have COVID-19 with minimal or even no symptoms at all,Asymptomatic infections have the same infectivity as symptomatic infections It has been reported that a 53 year old UK patient with an asymptomatic COVID 19 infection may cause 11 infections A report pointed out that one asymptomatic person who experienced 19 days from contact with the source of infection to RT PCR confirmation may have infected 5 people These asymptomatic cases may play a role in the transmission and therefore pose a significant challenge to infection control,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.05.001
0,Children cannot catch COVID-19,The underlying cause of the lower incidence and milder manifestations of COVID 19 in children is obvious Children especially younger children have been infected with numerous viral infections It is possible that repetitive exposure to numerous viruses can boost the immune system against SARS CoV 2 infection Additionally studies have shown that SARS CoV 2 tends to attach to angiotensin converting enzyme ACE which is premature in children and this may result in a low rate of infection with SARS CoV 2,

0,Children cannot catch COVID-19,COVID 19 appears to be relatively rare in children and children seem to present less severe symptoms compared to adults However the COVID 19 infection can occur in children via intrafamilial transmission if the virus spreads within the family through infected adults The first pediatric case of COVID 19 occurred in Korea on 18 February 2020 involving a 10 year old girl who had close contact with her uncle and mother who were both diagnosed with COVID 19 Most of the COVID 19 infection cases in children were found among family clusters as a result of close contact with other COVID 19 cases While in self quarantine infants and young children must be taken care of by their caregivers; self isolation of young children by themselves is almost impossible Although most of the infected children had mild or difficult to recognize symptoms at present there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines against the COVID 19 infection Understandably families with young children are anxious and concerned about the transmission of COVID 19,10.3390/ijerph17103723
0,Children cannot catch COVID-19,Infection with COVID 19 can be mild or severe and infected patients have clinical manifestation such as cough high fever chest pain lethargy weakness muscular pain and diarrhea Many infected children and newborns with COVID 19 have been identified all over the word Thus it is necessary to clearly characterize clinical manifestations and management of COVID 19 infection in this age group in order to provide accurate information for neonatologists and pediatricians Accordingly the present study was designed to review articles published on clinical manifestations and characteristics of children and infants with COVID 19,
0,Children cannot catch COVID-19,we found that the 10 children each had a history of close contact with adults infected with COVID 19 before the onset of their disease indicating that intrafamily transmission was the main route via which children become infected with the virus This was consistent with a number of previous studies The grand uncle of patient E was the first generation case and the maternal grandfather and father showed onset of disease after 4 days of exposure but the maternal grand uncle remained asymptomatic despite a positive nucleic acid test until 9 days later Patients G and J from family clusters with COVID 19 were both asymptomatic Based on these results it appears that the infection rate in children is not lower than that in adults and that children are susceptible within families with clustered disease onset Compared with adults however the clinical symptoms are generally mild and children recover faster The low incidence among children may be related to local governments initiating the highest level response to this public health emergency During such a response outdoor activities are limited minimizing the likelihood of coming into contact with the virus However more data are needed on inference analysis to confirm this,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104353

1,we often touch our faces without realizing it and that is a very easy way for coronavirus to spread,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 a respiratory infection that originated in Wuhan China is the talk of the town today It is caused by a virus that belongs to a family of viruses called coronaviruses and has been responsible for 169006 deaths so far Coronaviruses are of different types eg severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS CoV and have caused serious human illnesses SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes COVID 19 is a newer form which has been newly diagnosed in humans It is an enveloped RNA virus with positive sense RNA genomes ranging from 25 to 32 KB in length It is spherical in shape and ranges from 70 120 nm in diameter with four structural proteins The viral envelope is covered by characteristic spike shaped glycoproteins as well as the envelope and membrane proteins Studies have suggested that it can spread through close contacts and nosocomial secretions by coughing or sneezing Furthermore the fecal oral route has also been suggested as a mode of transmission People can protect themselves from being infected by washing hands frequently avoiding touching the face and avoiding close contacts especially with people who are sick,10.7759/cureus.8207
1,we often touch our faces without realizing it and that is a very easy way for coronavirus to spread,Obviously COVID 19 represents the largest acute health challenge for the society in the modern history of mankind According to the WHO report the crude mortality ratio reported deaths divided by reported cases is whereas these rates vary by country patient age and presence of co morbidities Most of those who have died were elderly about 80 of deaths were in those aged 60 and more and 75 of them had pre existing health problems including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes SARS CoV 2 could be transmitted from human to human and symptomatic individuals are the most frequent source of the disease As with other respiratory pathogens including flu and rhinovirus the transmission of SARS CoV 2 is believed to occur through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing Primarily the transmission of disease is facilitated when people are in close contact but it may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface and then their face At the moment the therapeutic strategies to deal with the COVID 19 are only supportive and reducing transmission in the community is the only one effective preventive measure which presumes isolation of patients and infected individuals and careful infection control,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109848
1,we often touch our faces without realizing it and that is a very easy way for coronavirus to spread,Strict hand hygiene is a simple and effective way to cut off the spread of the virus To reinforce the compliance of hand washing a two before and three after hand hygiene guideline is proposed Specifically the two before is to wash hands before patient examination and before treatment procedures the three after is to wash hands after touching the patient after touching the surroundings and equipment without disinfection and after touching the oral mucosa blood body fluid and so on Also orthodontic staffs should avoid touching their own eyes mouth and nose Hand hygiene should be also applied before eating as well as before and after using the bathroom to avoid the fecal oral transmission,10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.05.006
1,we often touch our faces without realizing it and that is a very easy way for coronavirus to spread,There can be various ways of transmission for this virus to infect the human population Spreading or transmission of COVID 19 can be through close contact of human beings or by touch or the aerosol spreading of the virus The most common way of spreading of this virus is through respiratory droplets as the infected one coughs or sneezes These micro droplets containing the virus can infect a healthy human by settling on the face mouth nose ears eyes or hands This virus can sustain for a long time on various surfaces which is also considered as a significant reason for its transmission Frequent touching of the facial area handshake and unavoidable touch to different surfaces while travelling through various transport means is also a significant threat to humans Also the transmission is known as hidden transmission by the carrier unknowingly spreading the infection to other population exists,10.1016/j.jceh.2020.04.020
1,we often touch our faces without realizing it and that is a very easy way for coronavirus to spread,Some experts talked about the downside to wearing a face mask and thereby opposed the idea that the general public should wear a face mask They said people wearing a face mask may be exposed to a higher risk of getting the infection if they touch their face more often if they wear the mask improperly or if they dispose of the mask unsafely There is a previous study showing that some people may touch their face times a day It was therefore argued that mask wearers who touch the mask on their face may be exposed to a higher risk of infection Such arguments are flawed in that there is no evidence that people who wear a face mask would touch their face more often than those who do not Indeed given the splash that one without a face mask may receive on the face during usual contact with other people people who touch their face often is likely exposed to the similar risk of infection regardless of whether they wear a face mask or not,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002819
1,we often touch our faces without realizing it and that is a very easy way for coronavirus to spread,Children are often playful They talk loudly and express themselves without restraints Evidence suggests that talking loudly and shouting may cause the spread of the infection through droplets Similarly touching the face nose and mouth with hand is common during play among children It also increases the risk of transmission of coronavirus infection Similarly children often spend a significant proportion of their time out of home in school play activities and may come in contact with individuals with coronavirus infection,10.1007/978-981-15-4814-7_7
1,we often touch our faces without realizing it and that is a very easy way for coronavirus to spread,Surface contamination has recently been found to be more significant than originally thought in the spread of many diseases Symptoms of respiratory disease often result in continuous recontamination of surfaces which are then touched and infectious virus particles may be transferred to facial mucosa In addition ineffective cleaning agents may leave residual particles that can initiate infection The use of biocidal surfaces may help to reduce the incidence of infections spread by touching contaminated surfaces Copper alloys have demonstrated excellent antibacterial and antifungal activity against a range of pathogens in laboratory studies Copper ion release has been found to be essential to maintaining efficacy but the mechanism of action is variable A reduction in microbial bioburden and acquisition of nosocomial infection has now been observed in clinical trials of incorporation of copper alloy surfaces in health care facilities,10.1128/mbio.01697-15

1,spraying and introducing bleach or another disinfectant into your body will not protect you against COVID-19,The best way to protect everybody against COVID 19 is done by frequently cleaning the hands By doing this we eliminate the viruses that may be on our hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching our eyes mouth and nose Some antiseptics such as alcohol or chlorine can try to kill the viruses that have already entered our body But these substances can be harmful to clothes or mucosal surfaces including eyes and mouth Soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls apart like a house of cards and dies or rather it becomes inactive as viruses are not really alive Viruses can be active outside the body for hours even days Disinfectants or liquids wipes gels and creams containing alcohol have a similar effect but are not as good as regular soap,10.1111/dth.13421
1,spraying and introducing bleach or another disinfectant into your body will not protect you against COVID-19,In the context of rule following during the COVID 19 pandemic if a rule is contradictory or incoherent with the listeners learning history then it is unlikely to be followed For example even if an authoritative figure tells you that injecting disinfectant may kill the virus you are unlikely to attempt this if your learning history allows you to frame ingesting disinfectant in opposition to staying alive Therefore in order to promote adherence to evidence based rules to reduce the spread of COVID 19 speakers must ensure their rules are sensical within listeners learning histories extending listeners relational networks as required,10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.002
1,spraying and introducing bleach or another disinfectant into your body will not protect you against COVID-19,This survey identified important knowledge gaps in the safe use of cleaners and disinfectants among US adults the largest gaps were found in knowledge about safe preparation of cleaning and disinfectant solutions and about storage of hand sanitizers out of the reach of children Mixing of bleach solutions with vinegar or ammonia as well as application of heat can generate chlorine and chloramine gases that might result in severe lung tissue damage when inhaled Furthermore exposures of children to hand sanitizers particularly via ingestion can be associated with irritation of mucous membranes gastrointestinal effects and in severe cases alcohol toxicity The risk of ingestion and consequent toxicity from improperly stored hand sanitizers cleaners and disinfectants can also extend to pets,10.15585/mmwr.mm6923e2
1,spraying and introducing bleach or another disinfectant into your body will not protect you against COVID-19,There is also need for more careful and comprehensive procedures for putting on and removing PPE In addition the basic environmental hygiene and disinfection measures should be put in place The environmental cleaning and disinfection regimes during the COVID 19 epidemic were similar in all areas surface cleaning and disinfection using chlorine based disinfectants were conducted twice per day There were some limitations in the process of environmental disinfection in the designated hospital First environmental surface disinfection was implemented by spraying a chlorine containing disinfectant However spraying cannot cover the surface evenly such as the corners and the effect of disinfection cannot be guaranteed without the wiping process Moreover spraying disinfectants may lead to harms to patients and health care workers thus spraying disinfection should not be recommended Second the cleaning work in the designated hospital was mostly done by volunteer cleaners during this special period They received the necessary training without professional experience,10.1016/j.ajic.2020.05.003
1,spraying and introducing bleach or another disinfectant into your body will not protect you against COVID-19,Consistent with current guidance for daily cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces a majority of respondents reported increased frequency of cleaning in the home However approximately one third reported engaging in high risk practices such as washing food products with bleach applying household cleaning and disinfectant products to bare skin and intentionally inhaling or ingesting cleaners or disinfectants These practices pose a risk of severe tissue damage and corrosive injury and should be strictly avoided Although adverse health effects reported by respondents could not be attributed to their engaging in high risk practices the association between these high risk practices and reported adverse health effects indicates a need for public messaging regarding safe and effective cleaning and disinfection practices aimed at preventing SARS CoV 2 transmission in household,10.15585/mmwr.mm6923e2
1,spraying and introducing bleach or another disinfectant into your body will not protect you against COVID-19,Broadly the most common disinfectant used against the SARS CoV 2 is diluted bleach a widely available and highly effective viral disinfectant Bleach has several downsides when considered for widespread use including common irritation of skin mucosal membranes and airways its instability when exposed to light and its high degree of reactivity with organic material Other common disinfectants such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are also effective and widely available but also have downsides such as flammability rate of evaporation and skin sensitivity In light of these disadvantages there is a need to develop new disinfectants that are effective against SARS CoV 2 but which do not cause sensitivity or irritation issues among exposed people and which can provide long lasting efficacy,10.1101/2020.05.08.082701
1,spraying and introducing bleach or another disinfectant into your body will not protect you against COVID-19,Participants were aware regarding clinical symptoms transmission prevention and control of disease contrast to myth busters questions More than one third participants agreed about eating citrus fruits and gargling salt water can help prevent infection According to WHO gargling warm or saltwater and consuming citrus fruits will not kill novel corona virus 14% out of hundred think alcohol drinking can kill novel coronavirus Alcohol are highly inflammable substance as well as strong disinfectants it can be used as a cleansing agent for surfaces No evidence supports alcohol consumption can kill the virus whereas intake of excessive alcohol can cause health related complications Robust association between gender and knowledge score regarding COVID 19 was found in the present study,10.1101/2020.05.05.20092122
1,There are many different kinds of coronaviruses,An astonishing diversity of coronaviruses was observed in bats in HKSAR In this study among the 13 different species of bats captured a total of eight coronaviruses were observed with six being previously undescribed This diversity of coronaviruses in bats could be related to the unique properties of this group of mammals First bats account for about 980 of the 4800 mammalian species recorded in the world Although HKSAR is an urbanized subtropical city it has extensive natural areas with 52 different species of terrestrial mammals with 40% of the species being bats This diversity of bat species would potentially provide a large number of different cell types for different coronaviruses,10.1016/j.virol.2006.02.041
1,There are many different kinds of coronaviruses,Thus it was believed that the new coronavirus originated from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan and spread from animal hosts to humans in the process of wildlife trade transportation slaughter and trade Bats have the most variety of coronaviruses in their bodies and are the hosts of many kinds of coronaviruses such as the SARS CoV and the MERS CoV The SARS CoV and the MERS CoV are considered highly pathogenic and it is very likely that the SARS CoV was transmitted from bats to palm civets and the MERS CoV was transmitted from bats to dromedary camels and finally to humans Given the high sequence similarity between the SARS CoV 2 and the SARS like bat CoVs from Hipposideros bats in China the natural host of the SARS CoV 2 may be the Hipposideros bat The discovery that pangolin coronavirus genomes have 85% to 92% sequence similarity to SARS CoV 2 suggests pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of SARS CoV 2,10.1007/s10096-020-03899-4

1,There are many different kinds of coronaviruses,Some care is needed in deducing mechanisms of activation and cell entry and hence potential therapies on the basis of using different types of virus as reference models This is because there are four main types of coronavirus with differences in spike proteins and it is known that here are some differences in activation and lung cell entry Renaming the believed causative agent of COVID 19 to indicate it as a type of SARS does not alleviate the concern that different strains use different mechanisms very few point mutations might change the modes of cell entry,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103670
1,There are many different kinds of coronaviruses,Thus SARS virus may induce systemic infection The primary determinant of target cell specificity of the virus is the nature of its cellular receptors Type I coronaviruses use aminopeptidase N of various animal species as receptors in a species specific manner while a type II coronavirus (MHV) uses the carcinoembryonic antigen as receNor The receptors for type III viruses and SARS virus are not yet known It should be noted that the virus easily adapts to cell lines of different animal species probably by using other related molecules as a receptor Thus the specificity of the spike receptor interaction may not be very rigid Interruption of the binding between the spike protein and the receptor will be a potential means of inhibiting viral infection,10.1007/bf02256318
1,There are many different kinds of coronaviruses,The coronavirus and the influenza virus have similarities and differences In order to comprehensively compare them their genome sequencing data were examined by principal component analysis Variations in coronavirus were smaller than those in a subclass of the influenza virus In addition differences among coronaviruses in a variety of hosts were small These characteristics may have facilitated the infection of different hosts Although many of the coronaviruses were more conservative those repeatedly found among humans showed annual changes If SARS CoV 2 changes its genome like the Influenza H type it will repeatedly spread every few years In addition the coronavirus family has many other candidates for subsequent pandemics One Sentence Summary The genome data of coronavirus were compared to influenza virus to investigate its spreading mechanism and future status Coronavirus would repeatedly spread every few years In addition the coronavirus family has many other candidates for subsequent pandemics,10.1101/2020.04.26.063032
1,There are many different kinds of coronaviruses,Both viral infections elicit a very strong inflammatory response and are also able to circumvent the immune response There appears to be several ways that these viruses evade and otherwise redirect the immune response The pathways that lead to the induction of the antiviral type I interferon IFN response are common targets of many viruses and coronaviruses are no exception SARS CoV and MERS CoV are contained in double membrane vesicles that prevents sensing of its genome As with most coronaviruses several viral proteins suppress the type I IFN response and other aspects of innate antiviral immunity These alterations of the type I IFN response appear to play a role in immunopathology in more than one way In patients with high initial viral titers there is a poor prognosis This indicates that reduction of the antiviral response may lead to direct viral induced pathology,10.2217/fvl-2016-0060

1,coronaviruses are named after their appearance,Coronaviruses are very important pathogens that affect both humans and animals During epidemics they are a cause of some 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults and play a role in severe respiratory infections in both adults and children The human coronaviruses are divided into four genera; these include alpha coronaviruses beta coronaviruses and the latter include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS CoV gamma coronaviruses and delta coronaviruses The former two genera cause infections in humans Coronaviruses are medium sized enveloped positive stranded RNA viruses whose name derives from their characteristic crown like appearance in electron micrographs While until recently six human coronaviruses had been identified in December 2019 a seventh human coronavirus named SARS CoV 2 also a beta coronavirus was identified initially in Wuhan China and it has subsequently become pandemic As with the SARS epidemic the initial outbreak of the new coronavirus occurred during the Spring Festival in China the most famous of all festivals in China during which more than 3 million people travel countrywide creating favourable conditions for spread of the highly contagious virus All coronavirus infections are zoonotic and are passed on to humans,10.18772/26180197.2020.v2nsia3
1,coronaviruses are named after their appearance,Coronaviruses obtaining their name by their appearance under the electron microscope are common respiratory pathogens of mammals and birds Although human coronaviruses await conversion into cancer targeting vectors non human coronaviruses including feline coronavirus and murine hepatitis coronavirus A59 display significant oncolytic activity in human cancer cells in vitro The tropism of these viruses however has been changed which is necessary to achieve infection as non human coronaviruses do not normally infect human cells Viral tropism is thus determined solely on the basis of expression of the proper viral receptors on the cell surface; once inside the cells non human coronaviruses are capable of initiating productive replication This is the complete opposite to the avipoxviruses which readily infect human cells but do not multiply in them,10.1016/j.canlet.2007.02.002
1,coronaviruses are named after their appearance,Coronaviruses are members of the family Coronaviridae which includes two genera coronaviruses and toroviruses Coronaviruses are single stranded positive sense RNA viruses with a genome of approximately 30 kD the largest genome among RNA viruses These viruses were named coronaviruses because by electron microscopy they have club shaped surface projections that give them a crownlike appearance The genome encodes four or five structural proteins a spike protein a small envelope protein a membrane protein a nucleocapsid protein and sometimes a hemagglutinin esterase protein a varying number of open reading frames scattered among the structural genes and a polyprotein that is processed into multiple nonstructural proteins These nonstructural proteins participate in virus replication but are not incorporated into the virion Coronaviruses have also been isolated from a variety of animals and birds and in their respective species cause a wide range of respiratory gastrointestinal neurologic and systemic illnesses The coronaviruses have traditionally been divided into three antigenic groups human and animal viruses compose groups I and II and avian viruses group III,10.1016/b978-1-4377-1604-7.00374-2
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,It must be recognized that this is not likely to be straightforward with those who have severe and profound IDs Limitations on access to the community need to be explained For those living within residential settings appropriate precautions and protocols need to be developed for isolation should someone contract COVID 19 There are a number of resources that can be used by carers and families to help explain these challenges to people with IDs while emphasizing the need to monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID 19 including a fever new cough fatigue congestion shortness of or difficulty breathing chill muscle pain dizziness sore throat headache vomiting and diarrhea,10.1111/jppi.12352
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and or lethargy and drowsiness mental state and or lactate progressively increasing and or imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and or less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS CoV 2 diagnosis polypnea may be the most common symptom For treatment the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered Once cytokine storm is found in these patients anti autoimmune or blood purifying therapy should be given in time Furthermore effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely,10.1101/2020.03.30.20044545
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,Medical staff must have a sufficient understanding of emerging infectious diseases When encountering suspected patients it is necessary to ask for medical history in time to identify potential patients as early as possible and to make isolation and protection If a person is suspected to be infected isolation is required including the transfer of the patient to another designated place for treatment or direct placement of the patient into an isolation ward Isolation is an important measure but there are differences between isolation and quarantine Quarantine refers to the separation of individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious disease or pathogens but still healthy from those who are healthy and have not been exposed In other words quarantine is to conduct observation on healthy people who may have been exposed to infectious diseases and may spread the disease to others to determine whether they are truly infected The concept of observation originated from border screening,10.1101/2020.03.28.20046110
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,Isolation is different from quarantine and is the separation of ill or infected persons from others so as to prevent the spread of infection or contamination The hospitals use for isolation for COVID 19 people were widely disturbed in provinces which arise the good gesture which being use in this scenario throughout Pakistan to control the outbreak of COVID 19 The distributions of hospitals being used for isolation on districts basis,10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100681
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,This means that a single infected person can transmit the infection to approximately two other persons when there is no quarantine while there is a possibility of stopping further transmission of infection when quarantine is implemented However there is a chance that some of the exposed individuals will evade quarantine due to fear of stigmatization and death Therefore public health education awareness will help to correct their misconceptions and encourage them to accept the control measures Furthermore people that recovered need to share their experiences in quarantine and isolation centres with members of their community to enlist the cooperation of the entire community When there is no isolation of the infected not hospitalized individuals in the population the basic reproduction number 0 2 This means that one infected not hospitalized person will infect approximately three persons in the population The presence of isolation will help to reduce the number of infected not hospitalized individuals in the population The simultaneous implementation of the three interventions reduces the number of infected individuals compared to the implementation of two interventions in the infected population,10.1101/2020.06.08.20125393
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,Huremovic analyzed and compared the clear definitions and scope of common public health policies such as isolation quarantine shelter in place cordon sanitaire protective sequestration and social distancing Isolation is to restrict the persons who have an infectious disease in a specified geographical area separating them from healthy people and those who have not been exposed Different from isolation quarantine is to separate those who are still healthy but possibly exposed to an infective agent from those who are healthy but have not been exposed which is a restriction on the movement or communication of persons or the transport of goods in order to prevent the spread of disease Shelter inplace SIP is a variant of quarantine in which individuals are not restricted at a designated location but at where they were at the time eg Family Cordon sanitaire refers to restricting activities of the individual in a larger and more defined geographic area,10.1101/2020.03.28.20046110
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,Quarantine and isolation are two measures that can prevent or at least minimize the impact of infectious disease outbreaks In public health practice quarantine refers to the separation of persons or communities who have been exposed to an infectious disease Isolation in contrast applies to the separation of persons who are known to be infected There are several examples of Government imposed quarantine or travel bans ie at least 18 US states quarantined people returning from West Africa during the 2014 Ebola outbreak Now COVID 19 infection is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths By March 29 Italy reported 10023 deaths To contain the diffusion of the COVID 19 virus the Italian Government as well as others have enforced on the population The previous experience of the SARS outbreak showed the efficacy of timely quarantine and isolation measures Quarantine is often an unpleasant experience: loss of freedom uncertainty over disease status and boredom can create dramatic effects The potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine need to be weighed carefully against the possible long term negative effects on cardiovascular risk burden,10.1038/s41430-020-0646-z
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,Quarantine and isolation are two measures that can prevent or minimize the impact of infectious disease outbreaks In public health practice quarantine refers to the separation of persons or communities who have been exposed to an infectious disease Isolation in contrast applies to the separation of persons who are known to be infected,10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,Quarantine and isolation are effective measures to reduce diffusion of infection and to prevent pandemic However these conditions can induce depression anxiety anger and stress,10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020
1,for people who are confirmed to have COVID 19 isolation is appropriate,The outbreak of a pandemic can have catastrophic consequences not only from the point of view of the casualties but also economically Therefore it is essential to absolutely avoid it by taking the necessary measures at the right time something that has not been accomplished in Italy and the rest of the world According to these calculations the effective measures are social distancing and home isolation since there is no health system designed for ordinary circumstances that can be prepared for a pandemic when the number of infected individuals grows exponentially As can be seen the pandemic can develop in a few days and the number of casualties can be extremely high if the fatality rate and contagiousness of the disease are high The difference of only a few days in taking action can make a big difference in the prevention of this disaster,10.3389/fpubh.2020.00230
1,flattening the curve refers to using protective practices to slow the rate of COVID 19 infection,Officials and experts have been advocating action to flatten the curve a message that has reached mainstream consciousness The flattening the curve graphics have provided a simple to understand way of visualizing that a slower infection rate means less stress on the health care system Physical distancing has also been a strong and effective message as a protective measure to slow the infection rate when implemented early These are based on complex research but also provide clear messages intended for action One graphic that went viral was from Dr Singer at the University of California San Diego and art director Gary Warshaw who depicted the complex math in a simple way specifically that if one person transmits the infection to an average of 2 5 people and those 2 5 people each transmit to another 2 5 people and so on that within 30 days 406 people would be infected,10.3390/ijerph17093010
1,flattening the curve refers to using protective practices to slow the rate of COVID 19 infection,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan China has since spread throughout the world resulting in an ongoing pandemic the Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 as a consequence of which the world is facing a serious and acute public health emergency As of 5 June 2020 more than 6 63 million confirmed COVID 19 cases have been reported resulting in more than 391000 deaths around the world Currently there are no vaccines nor specific antiviral treatments for COVID 19 As a vaccine against SARS CoV 2 is not expected before 2021 the current strategy in managing this pandemic is to decrease and delay the epidemic peak known as flattening the curve The curve here refers to the evolution of the number of active infectious individuals in time Flattening the curve reduces the load on the health care system and slows down the rate of new infections,10.1101/2020.06.05.20123547
1,flattening the curve refers to using protective practices to slow the rate of COVID 19 infection,Consequently the low absolute value of lymphocytes may be used as a reference index in the diagnosis or to classify severity of SARS CoV 2 infections At present it is possible to predict prognosis using symptoms signs and imaging findings but there are challenges Symptoms signs and imaging abnormalities are often seen later in the disease course so early detection may be difficult In addition once the condition deteriorates it may lead to a vicious circle ultimately resulting in critical illness or death The care of these patients requires a high level of medical resources equipment and infrastructure Slowing the spreading of the disease helps to âflatten the curveâ which helps to prevent overtaxing of healthcare systems,10.1007/s12016-020-08792-8
1,flattening the curve refers to using protective practices to slow the rate of COVID 19 infection,In this paper we aim to solve this problem We analytically relate the R of the evolution of COVID 19 in a demographically heterogeneous structured population to the mobility patterns and the permeability of households under confinement We derive a mathematical expression that allows us to anticipate the result of mobility restrictions and confinement on the effective reproduction number of the spreading of COVID 19 in any specific region The dependence of R on the average mobility is nonlinear and presents a sudden transition at R 1 This transition separates a regime in which the mobility restrictions smoothly slow down the number of cases the effect known as flattening the curve to a regime in which these restrictions sharply decelerate the number of cases which we refer to as bending the curve The difference in the outcome of these two scenarios is very pronounced First the curve bending strategy provokes a drastic reduction in the infection speed attaining a lower attack rate than the flattening strategy,10.1101/2020.04.06.20054320
1,flattening the curve refers to using protective practices to slow the rate of COVID 19 infection,In order to keep the infection rate within the capacity of the health system ie below a critical threshold it is imperative that social distancing and protective measures are early in phase 4 this causes the infection rate to slow down and the peak to become lower an effect that is often referred to as flattening the curve On the other hand slowing down the infection rate results in much longer tails in phase 6 ie a similarly slower rate of the asymptotically fading out of the outbreak Additionally If no vaccination is available in phase 6 any deactivation of the quarantine measures re exposes the general population to undetected infections and the probability of a recurrent outbreak becomes higher In other words the more flat the curve is at the peak of the outbreak the longer is the fade out period is and with higher possibility of another outbreak,10.1101/2020.04.15.20066712
1,flattening the curve refers to using protective practices to slow the rate of COVID 19 infection,The first human cases of Covid 19 were identified in December 2019 Since then the virus has spread around the world and by March 2020 most European countries as well as the US had started to report sharp increases in the number of cases As we write this editorial in late April more than 2 million people have been infected around the globe and over 140000 people have died Worldwide researchers are on the hunt for a vaccine but initial results are not expected for several months Meanwhile the fight against the virus continues with strategies to mitigate its consequences and to protect high risk groups in the population In general measures of hygiene and distancing strategies now being used in most countries are aimed at slowing down the infection rateâat flattening the curve in order to avoid the collapse of overwhelmed health care systems,10.1186/s13034-020-00324-8
1,flattening the curve refers to using protective practices to slow the rate of COVID 19 infection,These include propensity age profile medical system effectiveness treatment options early detection etc The risk of an infectious disease is not controlled unless the infection rate slows down so called flattening the curve Once the rate peaks the rate then should decrease due to successful countermeasures whatever they are,10.1101/2020.04.10.20060319
1,routine testing of animals for Covid-19 is not recommended,We are still in the early stages of understanding how this novel virus affects humans let alone animals So more time and testing will be necessary to better understand how exactly SARS CoV 2 behaves in pets Routine testing of pets for SARS CoV 2 is not recommended at this time Instead it is currently being reserved for cases in which animal and public health officials believe a pet should be tested because it is linked to a person with confirmed COVID 19 However some testing has been performed,10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100090
1,routine testing of animals for Covid-19 is not recommended,Another mixed breed dog from the same residence tested negative Neither dog has shown signs of disease Both dogs are in quarantine and are continuing to be monitored and tested To date there have not been any reports of pets or other animals becoming ill and there is no evidence that domestic animals including pets can spread SARS CoV 2 Because the situation is ever evolving public and animal health officials may decide to test certain animals out of an abundance of caution The decision to test will be made collaboratively between local state and federal animal and public health officials After the decision is made to test state animal health officials will designate a state appointed veterinarian USDA accredited veterinarian or foreign animal disease diagnostician to collect the sample using appropriate personal protective equipment PPE and sample collection methods While we are recommending these as good practices it is important to remember that to date there have not been any reports of pets or other animals becoming ill with SARS CoV 2 and there is currently no evidence that pets can spread COVID 19 to other animals including people,10.3892/mmr.2020.11037
1,coronavirus can live on the shoe soles,Almost all positive results were concentrated in the contaminated areas; the rate of positivity was much higher for the ICU than for the GW The rate of positivity was relatively high for floor swab samples perhaps because of gravity and air flow causing most virus droplets to float to the ground In addition as medical staff walk around the ward the virus can be tracked all over the floor as indicated by the 100% rate of positivity from the floor in the pharmacy where there were no patients Furthermore half of the samples from the soles of the ICU medical staff shoes tested positive Therefore the soles of medical staff shoes might function as carriers The 3 weak positive results from the floor of dressing room 4 might also arise from these carriers We highly recommend that persons disinfect shoe soles before walking out of wards containing COVID 19 patients,10.3201/eid2607.200885
1,coronavirus can live on the shoe soles,COVID 19 was extensively distributed on hospital floors sickbed handrails trash cans and computer keyboard and mice The positive rate was relatively high for floor swab specimens maybe due to air flow and gravity causing most virus droplets to float to the ground Furthermore as health workers walk around the ward the virus can be transferred all over the floor as shown by the 100% positive rate from the pharmacy floor where there were no COVID 19 patients Moreover 50% of the specimens from the soles of the intensive care unit ICU staff shoes were positive Hence the soles of shoes might act as potential carriers It has been proposed that staffs disinfect their shoe soles before walking out of wards containing infected subjects,10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.05.018
1,coronavirus can live on the shoe soles,Frontline workers should remove all clothing and shower at their place of employment if possible Alternatively stripping clothing in the garage or designated entry spot of the home while placing soiled clothing in a garbage bag for laundering is preferred Shoes should be removed and placed in a plastic bin at the home entrance Cleaning soles of shoes with bleach is not recommended as it may increase risk of exposure,10.1016/j.pedhc.2020.07.004
1,coronavirus can live on the shoe soles,Recently published guidelines for performing autopsies with suspected COVID 19 were followed1516 Examinations were performed in a state of the art facility completed in 2018 with a negative pressure autopsy suite and a separate negative pressure isolation room The examination tables used for autopsies were equipped with a reverse flow air handling system The examiners were clad in PPE including N 95 masks eye protection disposable scrub caps gowns gloves and rubber shoes or boots Alternatively the examiners were clad in a disposable body suit with shoe covers and 3M Versaflo powered air purifying respirators with M series headgear The clothing worn under the PPE consisted of blue surgical scrub shirts and pants which were removed before exiting the lab and laundered in house Shoes worn during autopsy remained in the laboratory Shower rooms stocked with hygiene products and clean towels were available in the laboratory,10.1093/ajcp/aqaa062
1,coronavirus can live on the shoe soles,The CDC team reasoned that when an infected person coughs or sneezes the large respiratory droplets expressed from the patients mouth and nose are likely to transmit the virus from the infected patient to a healthy person The propelled droplets can land directly on the mucous membrane of the mouth nose or eyes of a nearby person or on the surface of objects These droplets may travel up to 4 m51 and may increase the risk of infection to HCPs Guo et al also identified SARS CoV 2 on shoe soles of HCPs working in intensive care units ICUs therefore shoes can carry the virus In an experimental study conducted by van Doremalen SARS CoV 2 remained viable on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to 3 days,10.1017/ice.2020.237
1,coronavirus can live on the shoe soles,Strict biosecurity in quarantine and isolation areas with attention to traffic patterns and the use of protective clothing such as gowns and shoe covers is essential Footbaths are insufficient to prevent transfer of infectious agents on shoes This is because disinfectants typically require 10 minutes of contact time and may be poorly effective in the presence of organic debris In fact footbaths may even contribute to the spread of disease Dedicated boots or shoe covers should be used when entering contaminated areas In addition separate designated staff should care for animals in high biosecurity areas whenever possible,10.1016/b978-1-4377-0660-4.00046-6
1,coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air,A recent study on aerosol and surface stability found that SARS COV 2 was stable for three hours in its aerosol form This indicates that air transmission of the virus is possible due to its capability to remain viable as an aerosol While aerosolized viral particles cannot travel far from an infected patient breathing normally coughing and sneezing can lead to traveling distances up to an estimated 20 feet These particles then remain suspended in the air near or far from their surface depending on how the particles were produced or fall out of the air and attach to surfaces in the case of larger particles Once these particles have attached to various surfaces the length over which these particulates remain viable depends on the material of the surface Under experimental conditions it was found that SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV 1 had similar stability times,10.3390/diagnostics10060409
1,coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air,Between infected hosts COVID 19 is primarily transmitted through contact with droplets that contain viral particles Droplets are any medium in which a human can release the virus such as coughs sneezes and mucous They generally cannot travel more than 2 meters from their origin though simulations investigating the effects of aerodynamics on the spread of these droplets suggest that fast physical activity such as running or cycling increases the distance they can travel While it is generally thought that droplets do not linger in the air in one study SARS CoV 2 was found to last in the air for 3 hours in experimental conditions This disease can also spread by a person touching contaminated surfaces then subsequently touching their facial area,10.1111/febs.15375
1,coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air,The CDC recommends that PPE includes gloves and gown in addition to the standard precautions referenced previously Droplet precautions are initiated in instances when infection is spread through direct contact with contaminated dropletsie talking sneezing coughing Droplets are large and therefore do not remain in the air for very long or travel very far when projected from an infected patient Influenza meningococcus Haemophilus influenza mycoplasma pertussis mumps and rubella are all pathogens that may be transmitted by droplets The CDC recommends PPE that includes mask eye protection gloves and gown It was initially thought that COVID 19 was spread through droplet transmission like influenza however the rapid spread of COVID 19 indicated that it may spread via airborne particles Airborne precautions are necessary for airborne transmissible illnesses,10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100546
0,coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air,Currently there is a large amount of disagreement in the reported spectra of droplet sizes in respiratory events The analysis is complicated by various factors including the evaporation of the droplets as they travel from the source which in turn is influenced by ambient humidity and temperature Recent mathematical modelling of droplet emission during talking have categorised droplets into one of three groups small intermediate and large Small droplets approximately follow the air and can travel a great distance by weakly feeling the effects of gravity Large droplets can also travel a large distance due to their inertia However the intermediate-sized particles feel strongly both gravity and drag and their trajectory is a complex interaction of these effects Similar trends were observed in computational fluid dynamics simulations of previous authors,
0,coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air,From the physics point of view we cannot find a good justification for a stationary 6 feet separation in a situation when people spend long time together in a room Droplets containing the virus move in the air via convection The convection pattern in a room can be very complex It depends on the location of air conditioners radiators windows and all items in the room as well as on people producing vortices by moving around The existing vortices in the air can make a location far away from the source of droplets more dangerous than the location 6 feet away This applies to meeting rooms office spaces supermarkets department stores etc The airflow pattern should be studied for all such facilities to avoid the spread of infection to large distances from a single infected person The safest rooms must be those equipped with the air sucking ventilator at the top like hospital surgery rooms,
1,coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air,Virus transmission in this outbreak cannot be explained by droplet transmission alone Larger respiratory droplets more 5 remain in the air for only a short time and travel only short distances generally less 1 m The distances between patient A1 and persons at other tables especially those at table C were all 1 m However strong airflow from the air conditioner could have propagated droplets from table C to table A then to table B and then back to table C,10.3201/eid2607.200764
1,coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air,All these viruses can be aerosolized as they can be attached to fine aerosols solid particle or droplet from infected person but the coronavirus is better equipped with prominent spikes for better anchorage to their carriers during transport as well as their host cells Once airborne there is possibility that they can be transferred to ambient aerosols during their flight as well The smaller the aerosol that the virus is attached to the longer that the combined aerosol virus and carrier aerosol is suspended in air or airborne the longer distance for which the virus can spread Similar phenomenon can be found in air pollution in that the finer the particulates the longer they are suspended in air and further they can travel,10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116887
1,coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air,Beyond a shadow of a doubt a major question the pandemic has been how far would be far enough to elude droplets and to diffuse droplet nuclei if a person nearby is coughing or sneezing The rule of thumb for this pandemic has been a 2 m separation Nevertheless this has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection Indeed a gas cloud model suggests that a cough or sneeze could send respiratory particles as far as 8 m and actually airflow patterns in a room might influence the distance even a droplet could travel In this paper we provide new guidance to address this question by introducing a physics model for SARS CoV 2 transport in air,
1,coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air,Having confirmed airborne transmission of SARS CoV 2 a mode of transmission that is relevant to several previously known respiratory viruses including influenza scientists are now questioning whether the virus can travel even greater distances through the air by becoming lodged in other airborne particles such as condensed water vapor or even dust Such a mode of transmission would be extremely concerning and would call into question the adequacy of measures that are mostly designed to address issues related to proximity to an infectious individual such as wearing masks washing hands and surfaces and general social distancing,10.1016/j.mtphys.2020.100249
0,mosquito transmit coronavirus,Also SARS COV 2 transmission through food food packages and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease According to the latest studies the possibility of transmitting SARS COV 2 bioaerosol through the air has been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmology The results additionally show that infectious bio aerosols can move up to 6 feet There have been no reports of SARS COV 2 transmission by blood feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes,10.1186/s13568-020-01028-0
1,some young adults have suffered strokes after getting coronavirus,Reports of severe and even fatal strokes have appeared in COVID 19 including cases of young and middle aged adults Some of these strokes in the young have been due to multiple emboli This surprising finding may be a direct result of DIC but could also reflect opening of patent foramen ovale with paradoxical cerebral embolization,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110022
1,some young adults have suffered strokes after getting coronavirus,This reduction in stroke activity is seen despite patients with COVID 19 perhaps being at increased risk of thromboembolism and that vascular inflammation might also contribute to the hypercoagulable state and endothelial dysfunction in such patients There are reports of abnormal coagulation parameters in hospitalized patients with severe COVID 19 and elevated D dimer levels are strongly associated with in hospital death and many of them are receiving low molecular weight heparins In fact some young strokes without vascular risk factors related to COVID 19 are being reported Therefore alternative hypothesis to explain reduced numbers of stroke such as less activity and stress more sleep or other changes during the lockdown seem less plausible,10.1161/strokeaha.120.030106
1,some young adults have suffered strokes after getting coronavirus,In the past acute infections have been linked to stroke mainly among younger adults Therefore it is likely that also in instances of COVID 19 infection the systemic inflammatory response in the host rather than the viral invasion per se could be responsible for an elevated stroke risk However at present all studies on COVID 19 related stroke are observational and retrospective Studies evaluating the stroke risk after COVID 19 have not been performed thus far Furthermore study results may be biased by low numbers absence of appropriate control subjects with recent infection and multiple selection biases so the data is inconclusive There is preliminary evidence for an association between COVID 19 and stroke but causality has not been established The preliminary observed association could be explained by residual confounding incomplete ascertainment and insufficiently controlled studies Before assuming causality (Koch postulates) a specific link between SARS Cov 2 and stroke should be fully established Thus at the moment no changes in the routine stroke care should be implemented as an adjunct to antiplatelets antithrombotics and statin therapies that are already practiced in clinical settings,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104941
1,some young adults have suffered strokes after getting coronavirus,Considering the susceptibility of certain systemic autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome in females the importance of selected diagnostic workup algorithms in different sexes should be considered in further studies and clinical practice What is more although rarely seen in our research infection especially viral infection like coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 which may become more prevalent in the etiologies of ischemic stroke in young adults in the future need to be put more emphasis on in further researches,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105087
1,some young adults have suffered strokes after getting coronavirus,COVID 19 can further lead to changes of coagulation and in particular to inflammation induced disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC Together with endothelial dysfunction DIC can cause cerebrovascular ischemia even in young patients many of whom suffer from large vessel ischemic stroke Overall this may also be influenced by the severity of the COVID 19 infection as 5% of the severe cases suffered from ischemic stroke or had pre existing vascular risk factors especially in the elderly in whom ischemic stroke rather occurred as a delayed complication Additionally as sub acute signs that occurred 3â10 days after the development of Covid 19 symptoms Guillain Barre syndrome and Miller Fisher syndrome cases have been reported Also clinically striking are cases of Kawaski like multisystem inflammatory syndromes now being recognized in children and teenagers,10.1186/s13195-020-00640-3
1,some young adults have suffered strokes after getting coronavirus,The mortality was 38% among the stroke patients Five patients were classified to have large vessel stenosis and three each were classified into small vessel disease and cardioembolic stroke A very recent report describes five young patients with acute stroke during acute COVID 19 disease All presented with major intracranial vessel occlusion and had severe strokes treated with intravenous thrombolysis and or endovascular treatment Three patients had atherosclerotic risk factors and one of them had a previous stroke Elevated D Dimer levels were present in three patients This suggests a complex relationship between conventional risk factors infection and stroke and raises a concern about relatively younger patients developing a stroke during the ongoing pandemic the cause and effect relationship however remains unclear,10.4103/aian.aian_380_20
0,some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types,blood type discrimination in the COVID 19 fighting battle Since blood type is not risk factor for ARDS AKI and mortality average people and health care workers should not overestimate the genetic susceptibility by placing a certain blood group at risk for poor prognosis This kind of research methods also may be useful for evaluating the relation between blood type and other diseases such as West Nile virus infection hepatitis C diabetes mellitus and so on The susceptibility of different ABO blood groups to these diseases has also been investigated while the progression or prognosis has not been analyzed yet,10.1101/2020.04.15.20063107
1,some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types,Wuhan University research tested different sources of ABO blood from 369 virus infected patients and found 32% 24% 9% and 33% for A B AB and O respectively It has proposed a high type A contingent and a low type O contingent These results reflected blood tests in another hospital followed by 37% 26% 10% and 25% A similar pattern has been reported for mortality rates with 206 deaths at 41% 24% 9% and 25% respectively in classes A B AB and O Based on these findings it is suggested that people with blood type A are at significantly higher risk of infection than people with other ABO blood types which may be due to the presence of anti A antibody in the blood However more clinical trials are needed to support this association of ABO blood groups and COVID 19,10.7759/cureus.8439
0,some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types,At begin of exponential phase of Covid 19 infection the infection cases were comparable between the higher and lower blood type A groups but at Dpp the infection cases were distinctly higher in group with higher blood type A than that with lower blood type A which was also the case for to DCDpp,10.1101/2020.07.12.20152074
1,some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types,Growth rate of infection and death cases correlated significantly to blood type A proportion of the population positively while to blood type B proportion negatively In comparison with lower blood type A population people with higher blood type A had more infection and death cases in the early exponential phase higher growth rates and shorter case doubling time for infection and death Discussion Covid 19 infection is significantly associated with blood type distribution and people with blood type A are more susceptible to Covid 19 infection and have higher epidemic dynamics and higher case fatality rate The results of this study provide important and useful information for fighting Covid 19 pandemic,10.1101/2020.07.12.20152074
1,some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types,All these results mentioned above strongly demonstrate that the epidemic dynamics of Covir 19 infection is associated with the distribution of blood types worldwide not only infection cases but also death cases People with blood group A are therefore more susceptible to Covid 19 infection and their case fatality rate though Covid 19 infection is higher,10.1101/2020.07.12.20152074
1,some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types,Furthermore the previous study was aimed at investigating an individuals inclination to SARS virus infection and was conducted on 45 younger healthcare workers who were exposed to an index SARS patient It is difficult to determine why the blood type A population is more susceptible to SARS CoV 2 virus Actually in most situations why some diseases occur in a specific blood type population is not yet clear except that Duffy blood type defects determine the malaria infection in Africa,10.1101/2020.04.15.20063107
1,some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types,If one looks the Covid 19 infection map provided by Johns Hopkins University JHU for example the map picture on May 15 2020 one would immediately recognize that there is quite a difference among the geographic districts In fact after the initial outbreak in China the Covid 19 pandemic speedily advanced to Europe and simultaneously to New York City and afterwards this pandemic spread to South America and East Mediterranean zones Trying to understand the factors that have profound impact on the pandemic is crucial for bringing the pandemic under control since factors associated with the pandemic must be considered to make public policy and medical decisions ABO blood types are attributed to diverse infectious diseases like malaria HIV and influenza It has been reported that among the confirmed Covid 19 infection cases that were treated in the hospitals the proportion of blood type A was significantly higher than that of blood type B and furthermore it has been reported that the severity and clinical outcome of the Covid 19 infection disease were associated with blood types,10.1101/2020.07.12.20152074
1,some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types,The proportion of patients with type A blood in the COVID 19 group was significantly higher than that in the control group while the proportion of patients with type O blood in the COVID 19 group was significantly lower than that in the control group The risk of COVID 19 was higher for individuals with blood group A than for those with blood group O The risk of COVID 19 was higher for patients with blood group A than for those with a blood group other than A Patients with blood group O had a lower risk of COVID 19 than non O blood group patients The ABO blood group distribution was related to COVID 19 status Patients with blood group A had an increased risk for infection with SARS CoV 2 whereas blood group O was associated with a decreased risk indicating that certain ABO blood groups were correlated with SARS CoV 2 susceptibility Blood type was related to some clinical characteristics of patients with COVID 19,10.1016/j.cca.2020.06.026
0,some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types,Though these in vitro data suggest that natural anti HBGAs may provide protection against some viruses they have not been substantiated by epidemiological observations so far If natural anti A or B serum antibodies provide protection it is expected that during an outbreak blood group O individuals should experience a lower risk of infection than non blood group O individuals This has not been observed for either HIV or measles virus at present Yet it is precisely what was observed in the case of a hospital outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong where O blood group individuals appeared at a much lower risk of being infected by SARS CoV than subjects of other blood types Interestingly SARS CoV infects cells that express ABH antigens according to the individual's ABO phenotype Indeed SARS CoV infection has been documented in pneumocytes enterocytes of the small intestine as well as in cells of the kidney distal tubular epithelium all cell types known to be able to synthesize ABH antigens,10.1093/glycob/cwn093

1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,With the exposure of ACE2 as a target for SARS CoV 2 invasion blocking the combination of virus and ACE2 has become one of the therapeutic directions No approved drug regimen has been reported to treat infected cases so far However recently another proposed treatment Chloroquine an old drug for treatment of malaria has been suggested with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID 19 associated pneumonia While several drug trials are ongoing there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19  The misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID 19 Using monoclonal antibodies has not been proven in viral respiratory diseases and influenza as yet,10.1016/j.ijcha.2020.100583
1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,Hydroxychloroquine has antiviral properties demonstrated in vitro However currently there is no proof of its clinical effectiveness for prevention or cure Some preliminary data on a small number of patients were published on April 17 2020 Unfortunately a conclusion could not be obtained due to issues with methodology Recent observational studies did not find any differences in in hospital mortality Therefore it is not currently recommended to prescribe hydroxychloroquine either as monotherapy or in combination with azithromycin outside of supervised clinical trials,10.1016/j.jbspin.2020.05.006
1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,The CPAM china international exchange and promotive association for medical and health care recommends to take lopinavir 400 mg ritonavir 100 mg two tablets by mouth twice in daily or chloroquine 500 mg tablet by mouth twice in daily for older patients or patients with under underlying conditions and serious symptoms In case chloroquine is unavailable consider to use of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg by mouth once daily It cannot be recommended to take ribavirin and interferon drug because of the high risk for side effects but these drugs may be considered if treatment with lopinavir ritonavir chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are ineffective To this end some drugs have become promises other are being ruled out including lopinavir and ritonavir mix of two drugs used to treat HIV disease So far trial test results are confirmed as FDA approved therapeutics or drugs have not helped to treat cure or prevent COVID 19,10.1080/07391102.2020.1758788
1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,These treatments similarly do not have significant evidence to support their use presently but also carry risks of serious drug drug interactions Clinicians may be tempted and indeed are prescribing medications out of desperation to provide patients with some form of treatment for COVID 19 but caution and a rigorous review of possible interactions is warranted especially in older adults with polypharmacy Notably this population will often be underrepresented in clinical trials and even if proven effective harms may still outweigh benefits for some therapies and an individualized approach should always be taken Presently while some medications have shown promise such as hydroxychloroquine and more recently remdesivir no medication for the treatment of COVID 19 has been proven to be effective and so we would suggest that outside of a clinical trial the potential harms of off label prescribing likely outweigh benefits In the meantime it is important that we reduce the number of PIMs patients are taking as it may facilitate more treatment options once clinical evidence is established,10.1111/jgs.16623
1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,The limitations of the study by Gautret are not lost on seasoned academic researchers However despite warnings from healthcare leaders and public health agencies there continues to be a premature adoption of hydroxychloroquine as treatment based on limited preclinical data and misinformed interpretation of a nonrandomized study Importantly compassionate and well intentioned healthcare workers are not immune to these tendencies Arguably healthcare workers are more vulnerable to misinformation in our current climate as the careful and curious lens previously used to critically appraise the literature is now blurred by their intrinsic passion to do something Intentions aside misinformation is a current public health emergency If left unchecked preventable patient morbidity and mortality will occur while simultaneously dismantling the remarkable ongoing efforts to defeat COVID 19 There may be a risk to the integrity of not only hydroxychloroquine trials but also other investigational drug trials currently ongoing Widespread use and misconception of hydroxychloroquine being a cure may result in reduced enrollment in hydroxychloroquine trials or hesitation to enroll in other drug trials that are not hydroxychloroquine These potential ripple effects from misinformation pose the greatest threat to our ongoing fight against COVID 19,10.1097/cce.0000000000000108
1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,No specific cure exists for COVID 19 Potential COVID 19 therapies especially hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being investigated in ongoing trials but also have been used off label in many parts of the world These may exert QT prolonging effects and since recent observational data have questioned their efficacy require a careful risk benefit adjudication Combination therapy eg hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may have synergistic effects on QT prolongation In a retrospective cohort study of COVID 19 patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York cardiac arrest was more frequent in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin compared with patients who received neither drug,10.1016/j.jacc.2020.06.019
1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,COVID 19 is an acute resolved disease which can be deadly if not immediately and properly managed The severity of the disease is for massively causing alveolar damage with respiratory failure and consequently death However no pathology has been reported due to barely accessible autopsy or biopsy of affected patients Every country in the world is exhaustively trying to get a cure or preventative measures against this virus At present all treatments are symptomatic and supportive Despite that anti inflammatory and antiviral treatments have been employed no specific antiviral drugs have been confirmed effective,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106028
1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,To date management of COVID 19 has been largely supportive Several drugs approved for other indications eg chloroquine hydroxychloroquine lopinavir ritonavir sofosbovir ribavirin etc and some investigational drugs eg remdesivir favipiravir are being investigated to prevent or treat COVID 19 Surprisingly 33% and 54% of study participants were unaware that there was no vaccine and any approved cure for COVID 19 respectively Overall it was encouraging to see that the majority of university students and employees had good COVID 19 knowledge and attitudes,10.1007/s40267-020-00737-7
1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,The cardinal symptoms of COVID 19 are cough fever and shortness of breath These symptoms appear 2 14 days after infection The clinical picture varies from pausymptomatic to more serious clinical situations such as severe respiratory failure sepsis shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome Currently there is no specific treatment for COVID 19 so drugs need to be developed or reused to end the pandemic The World Health Organization has launched a clinical trial called SOLIDARITY to investigate 4 potential treatments: lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferon beta lopinavir and ritonavir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir The medical profession has quickly realized that there is no cure for this disease and vaccines will not be available for several months This leaves a large unmet need for safe and effective treatments for COVID 19 infected patients Obviously there is a very urgent need for a cheap viable and readily available treatment such as melatonin,10.3389/fmed.2020.00226
1,no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID 19,A primary tenet of evidence based practice is that therapy should only be used if the expected benefits are greater than the expected harm that could result from its use Since the benefits of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID 19 is seemingly unlikely the balance of benefits to harms is unfavorable For prevention the benefits are unknown so the balance of benefits to harm cannot be determined Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are generally safe and well tolerated but not free of adverse effects for patients or society In the limited experience with COVID 19 some patients have experienced QTc interval increases from baseline in excess of 60 ms while others have QTc intervals exceeding 500 ms In rare cases Torsade de Pointes or the more general endpoint of ventricular arrhythmias have been noted Additionally prolonged hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine exposure can cause retinal damage myopathy neuropathy aplastic anemia leukopenia and thrombocytopenia,10.1002/jcph.1687
1,rash is noted to be a coronavirus symptom,It is known that exanthematic rashes can occur during viral infection We can say that erythematous rashes during coronavirus infections may have the same origin as the other viral rashes Instead the vasculitic eruptions could be due to the vascular changes observed in these patients Degeneration of the endothelium and vascular damages including both formation of thrombus and congestion in small vessels were observed in organs other than the lung in autopsies from skin Indeed while the 2019 nCoV is mainly distributed in the lung the damage caused by the infection also involvesthe vessels with the possibility of ischemic and embolic damages,10.1111/jdv.16693
1,rash is noted to be a coronavirus symptom,Skin rash has been reported in 2% of patients with confirmed COVID 19 infection It can occur at the onset of the illness or during hospital stay The types of reported skin rash are erythematous Accepted Article rash widespread urticaria chickenpox like vesicles localised pruritic lesions and petechial skin rash Skin rash commonly involves the trunk However there is a reported case of skin rash localised to heal and spare the trunk Skin rash can be a delayed presentation in COVID 19 A case report described a patient presented with bilateral pruritic lesions in heals 13 days after the onset of typical symptoms of COVID 19 Furthermore skin rash has been reported as the initial manifestation of the disease In a case report a patient presented with diffuse erythematous urticarial rash 48 hours before he developed classical symptoms and diagnosed as COVID 19 Another interesting case report described a patient who presented with petechial skin rash and thrombocytopenia This case was initially misdiagnosed as Dengue fever,10.1002/jmv.26157
1,rash is noted to be a coronavirus symptom,The disease can affect different organ systems and early reports have suggested skin symptoms The researchers working with dermatologists across Spain reviewed 375 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID 19 with the aim of developing a detailed classification of the different types of skin symptoms associated with COVID 19 with corresponding images An initial 120 images were reviewed by four dermatologists without knowing any other clinical information and they identified patterns of symptoms associated with COVID 19 These patterns were then applied to the rest of the images and further refined Five common skin symptoms were identified this way These symptoms are chilblain like lesions outbreaks of small blisters wheals rashes comprised of small flat and raised red bumps and livedo and necrosis Livedo is a skin condition where circulation is impaired within the blood vessels of the skin necrosis refers to the premature death of skin tissue These symptoms are associated with different severity of COVID 19 infection from less severe disease in the chilblain like lesions to most severe in patients with livedo The researchers noted that some of the skin symptoms associated with COVID 19 are common and can have many causes particularly wheals and rashes As such they may not be particularly helpful as an aide to diagnosis,10.1111/bjd.19204
1,rash is noted to be a coronavirus symptom,In conclusion urticarial rash in combination with pyrexia is suggestive of COVID 19 disease Patients present such lesions in the early phase of infection Acute idiopathic urticaria and urticarial drug induced rash are major differential diagnoses Syphilis needs consideration Many viral infections develop rashes with mucosal involvement in contrast to COVID 19,10.1111/dth.13549
1,rash is noted to be a coronavirus symptom,The diffuse pattern is polymorphic and has a tendency to a widespread distribution The localized pattern is monomorphic and only involves the trunk COVID 19 vesicular rash usually appears after the onset of typical COVID 19 symptoms but it can also appear before them COVID 19 vesicular rash has no causal relation with antiviral drugs or other treatments,10.1111/ced.14277
1,rash is noted to be a coronavirus symptom,We describe a case of COVID 19 pneumonia in a young healthy male requiring hospitalization which presented with fever and extensive rash The rash was morbilliform maculopapular and nonpruritic and appeared consistent with a viral exanthem The clinical characteristics of COVID 19 have been described in several publications most thoroughly in a case series of 1099 patients by Guan Fever cough congestion and dyspnea are the most common presenting symptoms Only 2 of 1099 patients were noted to have any skin rash and the rash was not described; no other publications have noted or described skin manifestations as a presenting symptom Rash may be a rare presenting symptom of COVID 19 and should be kept in mind by front line provider,10.5811/cpcem.2020.3.47349
1,rash is noted to be a coronavirus symptom,Vesicular skin rashes have been associated to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID 19 but there is little information about this cutaneous manifestation We designed a prospective observational study of patients diagnosed with COVID 19 and vesicular lesions Clinical characterization of skin findings was conducted by dermatologists When possible histological analysis and detection of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 in the content of the vesicles was performed A total of 24 patients were included A disseminated pattern was found in 18 patients 75% and a localized pattern was found in 6 patients The median duration of the skin rash was of 10 days Out of all 19 patients 79% presented the skin rash after the onset of COVID 19 symptoms Histologic examination in two patients was consistent with viral infection SARS CoV 2 was not detected in four patients This monocentric study shows the clinical characteristics of vesicular skin rashes in COVID 19 patients,10.1111/ced.14277
1,rash is noted to be a coronavirus symptom,Vesicular rash appeared after COVID 19 diagnosis in 19 patients 79% with a median latency time of 14 days range 4 30 days A total 7 patients 29% had received specific COVID 19 treatments before the appearance of skin rash: lopinavir ritonavir hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin The rash was pruritic in 20 patients 83% while 4 16% did not refer any associated symptoms,10.1111/ced.14277
1,rash is noted to be a coronavirus symptom,seems to be a symptom of milder COVID 19 disease Typically it spares mucosa and palmoplantar skin Differential diagnoses include drug induced rash and rashes due to other viral diseases,10.1111/dth.13549
1,young adults have been hospitalized with coronavirus and some have died,In a United States study of COVID 19 cases from 50 states and 4 territories reported on April 2nd 2020 1% were persons aged less 18 years despite this age group accounting for 22% of the US population A portion of this population required hospitalization estimated at 5% 20% while 1% 2% required ICU admission This is consistent with previous reports that COVID 19 illness often has a mild course among younger patients Although symptoms of COVID 19 were typically less severe than those of adult patients young children particularly infants were vulnerable to infection in this study consistent with data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control Patients aged 15 17 years were the most common age group to be infected accounting for 1 3 of the cases but hospitalization was most common in patients aged less 1 year One out of 728 children confirmed to have COVID 19 died in the China study a 14 year old boy Three out of 2572 children died in the US study,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.152
1,young adults have been hospitalized with coronavirus and some have died,Nearly one in three young adults is medically vulnerable to severe COVID 19 illness To further our understanding of the impact of COVID 19 on young adults these findings need to be compared with other indicators related to severe COVID 19 illness such as hospitalization rates and mortality Reporting on these indicators for the young adult age group would help inform a public health response that takes this unique age group into account,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.025
1,young adults have been hospitalized with coronavirus and some have died,A total of 53 young COVID 19 patients were included and 13 of whom were died from COVID 19 while the rest of them are survivors Among those deceased patients 9 cases were mild type and 3 cases with severe type and 1 case with critical type in terms of disease severity at the time of admission but all patients were died of COVID 19 within the week of admission Remarkably obesity was characterized as the critical factor contributing to the death of these patients as evidenced by the fact that the body mass index BMI of the young deceased patients is significantly higher than that of the survivors obese individuals had a greater risk of hospitalization and death for H1N1 than individuals with normal weight Notably the prevalence of pneumonia by COVID 19 53% was higher than H1N1 influenza 11% therefore the risk of COVID 19 patients with obesity should not be underestimated Moreover according to the data analysis of single cell sequencing the expression of SARS CoV 2 receptor ACE2 in fat cells is found to be high which supported the assumption that obesity may be a risk factor for the poor prognosis of young COVID 19 patients,10.1002/jmv.26039

1,young adults have been hospitalized with coronavirus and some have died,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 is a pandemic viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC as of May 19 2020 1 million patients have tested positive to COVID 19 in the US Of those 89407 6% patients have died As the COVID 19 continues to spread the younger population is also being critically affected Comorbidities such as coronary artery disease CAD hypertension HTN and diabetes mellitus DM have been identified as risk factors for hospitalization and mortality Obesity was also shown as an important risk factor for severe COVID 19 disease In previous publications the median age of COVID 19 patients was around 60 years and thus the risk factors that were highlighted are predominantly in the older population Identifying comorbidities linked to poor outcome in the young is crucial,10.1002/oby.22913
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,A number of studies have articulated that the COVID 19 virus is airborne Respiratory droplets evaporate and their diameters thus become small enough to suspend in the air in the form of droplet nucleus The nucleus can stay in the air for a long time and if they carry the virus they will undoubtedly jeopardize the susceptible population However the mechanism of airborne transmission and infection is complex and need further investigation Owing to the low percentage of quality and number of small droplets which might evaporate into the air and become nucleus before their deposition this study focused on the primary risk through the droplet route as defined by WHO and US CDC The convection flow around human body is also an important factor impacting the droplets transmission but to simplify the transmission model this factor was not taken into account Besides the risk from physical/surface contact is still unclear and not included in this study It is necessary and valuable to propose a comprehensive scheme that can evaluate the risk from all possible routes,10.1016/j.scs.2020.102390
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,Sometimes however superspreaders were identified passing the virus to those not in close proximity This raises the likelihood of airborne spread by droplet nuclei microscopic hot air balloons that encase the virus and allow it to stay suspended in the air currents for hours This situation would be analogous to what happens with influenza measles or tuberculosis Eventually the tiny droplets can be inhaled and reach all the way to the alveoli,10.1016/j.arcmed.2005.03.040
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,Persistence of most bacteria fungi and viruses eg SARS CoV on surfaces depends on environmental conditions such as air temperature and RH inoculums and the materials that they stayed on Low temperature high inoculums and proper RH are associated with longer persistence time for most viruses The role of the environment on the survival of viruses in the air may be more complex and significant RH impacts the survival time of viruses and the relationship between the inactivation of RH and temperature was not monotony The temperature impacts the survival of the virus more significantly than that of RH In all water types tested reagent grade water lake water and settled sewage the titer of infectious virus declined more rapidly at 25 C than at 4 C,10.12998/wjcc.v8.i8.1391
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,Airborne droplets can reach the airways in a calm environment a 4 Âµm particle takes 33 minutes to move 1 metre and a 1 Âµm particle takes 8 hours However it must pass through the nasal filter whose filtration capacity is not linear On the microscale the bigger the particle the more it is filtered On the nanoscale it is the reverse the smaller the particle the more it is filtered For calm respiration 10 15 L min 100% of 20 Âµm particles settle in the nasal fossa and the cavum 40% for 9 to 11 Âµm particles and only 4% for those from 2 Âµm,10.1016/j.anorl.2020.05.015
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,With respect to non-hermetically sealed eye protection as illustrated some droplets will be stopped and some protection is achieved For example in the event of a sneeze directed towards the lenses of the eye protection device many particles will be stopped It is still possible however that airborne particles carrying the virus can pass around the lenses come in contact with the eyes This is because the droplets from the external environment can pass over under or around the lenses enter the air mass in front of the eye and contact the surface of the eye as illustrated in Figure 1B With respect to hermetically sealed eye protection as illustrated in Figure 1C  the droplets do not enter the air mass in front of the eye as illustrated,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.040
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,The survival probability of the virus in the dry air is then given by the likelihood of survival outside its natural environment The half life of SARS CoV 2 in aerosols has been found to be about 1 hours We have seen that the coronavirus can go airborne staying suspended in the air However the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets produced mostly while sneezing and coughing Then to ascertain whether airborne transmissible SARS CoV 2 can survive and stay infectious in aerosols we must double check that the falling time of a droplet from a height of about two meters is larger than its evaporation time scale To this end we assume that the drops are also spherical and hence the mass can be simply estimated as,
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,While N95 filtering facepiece respirators FFRs were made for single use operation the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic has caused a shortage worldwide of these FFRs COVID 19 caused by the SARS CoV 2 virus has been shown to be very contagious and spread through aerosolized droplets These aerosols can remain in the air for hours increasing the risk of contagion to those nearby In order for an N95 mask to be reused more safely the mask should be decontaminated of SARS CoV 2 while maintaining its filtration efficiency and fit factor Currently limited information is known about SARS CoV 2 inactivation,10.1371/journal.pone.0234851
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,Aerosol May refer to either an aerosol particle or a suspension of liquid droplets droplet nuclei or particles in air Aerosol particles in the present context may contain infectious pathogens epithelial and other cells or remains of those natural electrolytes and other substances from mucus and saliva and water typically evaporating rapidly depending on the relative humidity of the surrounding air Aerosol particles remain in the air for long enough for them to be inhaled and they can be transferred over long distances by indoor air flow For drying liquid droplets a several minute time of remaining airborne is numerically demonstrated in still ambient air while ambient flow can sustain those droplets for much longer times in the air For example in the CFD simulations herein solid particles with d 20 Âµm having density of water are demonstrated to behave as aerosols lingering at least several minutes in the turbulent air flow in conditions relevant to public places,
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,Once exposed to the environment through a droplet from an infected person it can last from a few minutes to several hours up to a few days depending on the type of surfaces If a person touches their nose or eyes or pulls it out of their breath there is a possibility of getting infected Studies show that it can stay in the air for up to three hours on a copper ring up to four hours a full day on cardboard and on plastic and stainless steel it can last up to 2 3 days In the high phase of the epidemic outbreak each infected person can infect in average around 3 5 other persons,10.3390/s20113089
1,the virus can stay in the air for minutes,It is of course not straightforward to derive the infection risk from the virion inhalation frequency It is known that SARS CoV 2 viruses remain viable in aerosols for at least 3 hours which is longer than the sedimentation times in the relevant radius range As a comparison on an inanimate surface these viruses stay infectious for days As a further complication the relative humidity seems to have a significant influence on virus stability it was shown for bacteriophages and influenza viruses that stability is minimal at intermediate humidities around RH 05 and is increased both for lower and larger humidities Unfortunately similar data is not yet available for SARS CoV 2 viruses Many factors determine the likelihood that a virus will spread from one person to another and that disease will result but for other viruses it is known that inhaling as few as 5 virions can cause infection,
0,spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces such as streets or marketplaces is recommended to kill the COVID 19 virus,Outdoor areas Outdoor areas of the clinic would need less intense disinfection by being exposed to sunlight and air currents However cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces should be carried out here as well,10.1111/dth.13597
0,spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces such as streets or marketplaces is recommended to kill the COVID 19 virus,Although we did not demonstrate SARS CoV 2 infectivity by viral culture and only collected limited numbers of samples owing to the strict control during the COVID 19 outbreak in Wuhan our study unravels the distributions of SARS CoV 2 in soils aerosols waters and surfaces covering the major outdoor environments of hospitals Although viruses might decay rapidly from these high risk areas and regular disinfection can effectively eliminate SARS CoV 2 the overall risks of hospital outdoor environment are significant particularly in those high risk areas,10.1101/2020.05.12.20097105
0,spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces such as streets or marketplaces is recommended to kill the COVID 19 virus,As the transport of aerosols has limited distance the high risk areas cover only a small proportion of hospital outdoor environment,10.1101/2020.05.12.20097105
1,spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces such as streets or marketplaces is recommended to kill the COVID 19 virus,It remains unclear about the distribution and transmission risks of SARS CoV 2 in outdoor environment despite its threats to healthy people and communities Here we investigated the presence of SARS CoV 2 virus in 73 specimens from outdoor environment of three hospitals in Wuhan We found SARS CoV 2 in soils wastewaters and aerosols in locations close to departments receiving COVID 19 patients or in wastewater treatment sectors which revealed significant viral spill over in hospital outdoor environment that was possibly via respiratory droplets from patients or airborne aerosols from wastewater containing SARS CoV 2 In contrast SARS CoV 2 was not detected in other areas or on surfaces with regular disinfection Soils eventually behave as viral receptors through deposition and potentially a secondary source spreading SARS CoV 2 for a prolonged time Our findings map the high risk areas in hospital outdoor environment possessing spread risks of SARS CoV 2 which require particular attention and complete sanitation for preventing SARS CoV 2 outdoor transmission,10.1101/2020.05.12.20097105
0,I can disinfect my mask by putting it in the microwave,It is often considered as good practice to sterilize the masks by killing the secondary pathogens before reusing Many authorities governments manufacturers scientists and experts are looking to expand the availability facemask by sterilizing them with effective methods Under these premises multiple potential methods for sterilization have begun to be explored Some are based on chemical methods hydrogen peroxide chlorine dioxide bleach alcohol soap solution and ethylene oxide ozone decontamination etc and physical methods dry steam heat treatment UV light sterilization electron beam and gamma irradiation etc All above sterilisation method having advantages and disadvantages from one than others Among the different methods the available literature seems to point out that the most promising methods are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor ultraviolet radiation moist heat dry heat ozone gas and gamma irradiation The methods that are not recommended for disinfection or sterilization such as cleaning with soapy water alcohol bleach immersion ethylene oxide microwave high temperature autoclave or steam because they can significantly degrade the filter because they alter or degrade the electrostatic properties of the filter fibre sand affect particle penetration levels leading to mask degradation,10.1101/2020.06.04.20121830
0,I can disinfect my mask by putting it in the microwave,Protocols currently being explored for reusing face masks include microwave steaming ultraviolet radiation and autoclaving all have serious limitations and uncertainty of their outcomes Realtime disinfection of PPE is an ideal solution for the challenge of extending its useful lifetime The idea is not new but commercial production has not been viable We now have the opportunity to re think investments in research on green materials that have intrinsic disinfection properties are long wearing and are recyclable Such materials will save the lives of front line emergency responders and hospital based healthcare professionals while also contributing to when used in concert with policies such as social distancing,10.1007/s11837-020-04207-3
0,I can disinfect my mask by putting it in the microwave,Pristine masks achieved an average bacterial filtration efficiency of 99% whilst single and triple dry heat reprocessed masks had a filtration efficiency of 95 and 99% respectively There were no statistically significant differences in performance compared to the pristine control In contrast surgical masks reprocessed via microwave generated steam exhibited a complete loss of bacterial filtration efficiency Microwave reprocessed face masks were observed to lose their rigidity immediately following reprocessing and were noted to become significantly more wet during the nebulisation procedure possibly indicating reduced water repellent properties,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.07.008
1,patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma,The FDA has approved the administration of convalescent plasma containing specific antibodies against SARS CoV 2 Besides the FDA has recommended that people who have recovered from COVID 19 for at least two weeks should donate their plasma to help other patients It is estimated that each donation can provide sufficient plasma for four patients,10.1016/j.cca.2020.05.044
1,patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma,In India many of the recovered patients of COVID 19 are ready to donate their plasma to save the lives of other infected individuals The plasma collected from one recovered patient can be sufficient to treat two to three COVID 19 patients,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.023

1,patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma,Convalescent plasma was obtained from individuals who had recovered from COVID 19 Young adult individuals who recovered from COVID 19 for one week to two weeks were eligible for further estimations as the blood donors Additionally all the donors were negative for the testing of SARS CoV 2 RNA and IgM and positive for IgG testing before donations Informed consent was obtained from all donors who should be seronegative for hepatitis B and C human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis From the mid February 2020 first recovered COVID 19 individual has donated the blood sample A 200 to 400 ml plasma sample was harvested from each donor the blood collection and storage process were performed in Henan Provincial Red Cross Blood Center Gold immnnochromatography for SARS CoV 2 IgM and IgG tests were performed using blood sample,10.1093/infdis/jiaa228
1,patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma,Yet these measures remain far from effective particularly in the developing world The reality of plasma donations is similar In Bolivia for instance although law 1716 forbids any kind of payment for tissue donation advertisements requesting paid plasma donations are common even in prime time TV and national newspapers Such strategy is likely to be successful as media coverage has been shown to positively impact organ and tissue donation rates Some regions have circulating lists of infected individuals Plasma donations are compensated with thousands of dollars several times the local average monthly salary and can be performed once a week Patients who recover following convalescent plasma infusion are then encouraged to donate their plasma In addition to resembling a pyramid type scheme such practice does not have a solid scientific rationale as these patients are highly unlikely to have developed any neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV 2 In fact even among individuals who recover from SARS CoV 2 on their own one third have low or undetectable neutralizing antibody titers Such a plasma black market is reminiscent of events in the 1990 in China where an HIV epidemic began with local pay for plasma schemes,10.1038/s41541-020-0209-2
1,patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma,Thirteen individuals donated convalescent plasma more than once range 2 to 7 donations The availability of longitudinal samples from the same plasma donors permitted us to assess the arc of anti ECD and anti RBD IgG titers and VN over time within individuals There was no significant decrease in IgG titers as assessed by the ELISA or VN titer even among donors who donated twice/week for up to seven donations Thus we observed stable high titers both within and between individual donors,10.1101/2020.06.08.138990

0,when you vape the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,Electronic cigarettes e cigarettes promoted as an alternative for cigarette smoking rapidly gained popularity in recent years in the US In 2018 the prevalence of current e cigarette use vaping in US adults was 3% Recent studies on the associations of vaping and health symptoms diseases have observed associations between vaping and symptoms of wheezing and self reported Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD along with increased inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells and alterations in the pulmonary immune response to infection Tobacco control researchers have raised concerns that vapers may be more susceptible to COVID 19 infections and could develop more severe COVID 19 symptoms However there is very limited evidence on the association between vaping and COVID 19,10.1101/2020.05.05.20092379
0,when you vape the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,The popularity of e cig vaping has been rising recently in the United States and hence health concerns about vaping have recently attracted public attention Our previous studies have shown that acute exposure to e cigarettes could cause inflammatory responses oxidative stress and ECM remodeling Although in the past we have shown the health risks caused by acute e cig exposures in mice sub chronic or chronic effects of e cig exposure induced toxicity and respiratory health effects remain elusive Based on our knowledge no study has yet shown that long term exposure of e cig aerosol can result in persistent dysregulated repair ECM remodeling and inflammatory responses implicating the role of the nAChRÎ±7 receptor in the lung,10.1186/s12931-020-01396-y
1,when you vape the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,The use of E cigarettes has rapidly increased and according to the most recent report by CDC released at the end of December 2019 2506 cases of lung disease and more than 54 associated deaths due to EVALI were reported Initial data shows that most patients use E cigarettes containing tetrahydrocannabinol THC some use nicotine while others used a combination of both nicotine and THC EVALI should be suspected in patients who have a history of vaping or other use of e cigarette related products and have a pneumonia like syndrome progressive dyspnea and or worsening hypoxemia all of which were found in our patient The main differential diagnosis for EVALI is community acquired pneumonia CAP which can be treatable with antibiotics The exact mechanism of the lung injury in vaping patients is not fully understood However vaping increases the susceptibility of the respiratory tract to both pathogenic and opportunistic infectious agents due to immune dysfunction In one study the inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin IL 6 and IL I were highly elevated in e cigarette users when compared with non users,10.1186/s13000-020-00998-w
0,when you vape the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,In conclusion these results do not support the hypothesis that smoking or nicotine is protective against SARS CoV 2 infection with current smokers and long term ex smokers reporting significantly greater odds of suspected infection than never smokers and no significant difference in odds of suspected infection by use of e cigarettes or NRT With the exception of washing hands before touching one s face there was high engagement in hand washing irrespective of nicotine product use Approximately one in ten current e cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping due to COVID 19 As countries begin to relax social distancing measures it is important to continue tracking how nicotine product use interacts with SARS CoV 2 infection and how this pandemic will influence smoking vaping and quitting behaviours in the population,10.1101/2020.06.29.20142661
1,when you vape the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,Although tobacco use in the US has decreased over time about 8% of adults aged 65 and over smoked cigarettes in 2018 In contrast the proportion of adults 65 years and older who reported prior year cannabis use increased from 2% in 2015 to 4% in 2018 with a greater increase among those who reported receiving mental health treatment or who also used alcohol There is strong evidence that smoking tobacco puts people at risk for more severe COVID 19 related symptoms; data from China indicate a case fatality rate of 6% for individuals with chronic respiratory disease compared with 2% overall Vaping nicotine is thought to be less harmful than combustible tobacco yet there are also growing concerns that vaping nicotine may damage lungs in ways that make users especially vulnerable to COVID 19 related symptoms,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.04.012
1,when you vape the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,while COVID 19 triggered quit attempts among some smokers in England far more attempts were triggered by other reasons like future health concerns It is possible that conflicting news stories reporting the possibility that smoking is protective against COVID 19 may have partially undermined attempts to encourage people to quit smoking Some organisations have also advised people to stop vaping arguing that e cigarette use makes one susceptible to SARS CoV 2 infection  despite little evidence to support this In our sample one in ten current e cigarette users attempted to quit vaping due to concerns about COVID 19 These attempts to quit vaping might stem from the deteriorating perceptions about the harms associated with e cigarette use among smokers in England,10.1101/2020.06.29.20142661
1,tobacco smokers are at especially high risk,Data from the previous Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS and severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS is scarce A single study from Korea reported a increased risk of mortality in smokers with MERS but this study included only eight smokers For COVID 19 data are also scarce; one review did not report on smoking as a risk factor for infection but did report an increased risk of severe disease and need for mechanical ventilation or death for current smokers Another meta analysis did not find an association between current smoking and disease severity The largest study to date from the UK reports an increased risk for death in current smokers compared with never smokers of 1 25 when adjusted for age and sex which decreased to 0 88 when fully adjusted,10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30239-3
1,tobacco smokers are at especially high risk,These population data combined with evidence of a worse outcome in smokers hospitalised with the condition support the contention that smoking increases individual risk from COVID 19 Support to help people to quit smoking should therefore form part of efforts to deal with the pandemic,10.1101/2020.05.18.20105288
1,tobacco smokers are at especially high risk,There is no evidence based treatment for the infection and prevention of transmission using social distancing isolation and hygiene measures is widely recommended Tobacco smoking is rampant in communities around the globe and the addiction to tobacco results in deaths of more than 8 million individuals each year As COVID 19 transmits through salivary droplets and causes severe lung pneumonia tobacco smokers are also at high risk of severe COVID 19 infection due to poor lung function cross infection and susceptible hygiene habits Smoking tobacco cigarette e cigarettes or waterpipe produces exhaled smoke coughing or sneezing aerosols containing SARS CoV 2 in the surroundings and contaminating surfaces Therefore smoking tobacco is a possible mode of transmission for the virus for both active and passive smokers Smoking should be considered a risk factor for the disease transmission until further availability of evidence and measures to limit its direct and indirect effects should be implemented within the community,10.12669/pjms.36.covid19-s4.2739
1,tobacco smokers are at especially high risk,In comparison to non smokers smokers have an increased risk of developing influenza and this infection can even exacerbate the comorbidities that are common in these populations It has also been reported that after influenza infection smokers are at higher risk of hospitalization compared to non smokers Tobacco smoke not only plays a crucial role in developing respiratory distress but is also associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular and neurological diseases like stroke Alzheimerâs disease multiple sclerosis and vascular dementia by disrupting the blood brain barrier inducing oxidative stress inflammation and the alteration of immune responses Noticeably the negative effect of smoking on the progression of COVID 19 infection has been reported in recent case studies and reports As smoking increases the risk and susceptibility of SARS CoV 2 infection increasing the progression of COVID 19 and leading to severe respiratory distress and cardiovascular disease this review article aims to determine plausible comorbid CNS and cerebrovascular roles of smoking and vaping in COVID 19 patients,10.3390/ijms21113916
1,tobacco smokers are at especially high risk,COVID 19 presents a powerful reason to quit tobacco We applaud the WHO s strong stance Whilst we await evidence there is concern that waterpipe and cigarette smoking increase the risk of infection People with a history of tobacco use are also more at risk of respiratory infections and may get worse symptoms if they get COVID 19 Therefore it is a good time for primary care to support smokers who want to quit because the evidence is strong about the increased impact of a supported quit attempt5 We urge primary care pharmacists GPs and other healthcare workers to actively seek out and support their tobacco dependent populations to quit Hypothetical benefits of nicotine in acute COVID 19 does not alter the public health message of the danger of smoking,10.1038/s41533-020-0187-x
1,tobacco smokers are at especially high risk,At current trajectories smoking will kill around one billion people in the 21 st century Evidence that current smoking increases individual and thus health system risk from COVID 19 is a strong argument for governments to accelerate rather than pause measures to deliver on tobacco control plans These should include options such as polluter pays levies on tobacco transnationals that will continue through the pandemic to be highly profitable as well as enormously damaging,10.1101/2020.05.18.20105288
1,tobacco smokers are at especially high risk,Concerning smoking and COVID 19 our data showed a pooled prevalence of 9% current smokers lower than the reported prevalence of smoking in China that was 25% The impact of smoking history on vulnerability to COVID 19 has been explored but there is limited data on the contribution of tobacco smoking to the spread of and poor outcome in COVID 19 A recent systematic review on COVID 19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associated with the negative outcomes This recommended further research to explore this in more detail due to limited studies Evidence from other respiratory viruses respiratory syncytial virus has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 the receptor for SARS CoV 2 However as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID 19 vulnerability in different groups,10.1101/2020.03.25.20043745
1,tobacco smokers are at especially high risk,The COVID 19 pandemic has exacerbated heath inequalities in England with the highest mortality rates found among people working in manual routine and service occupations and in black and ethnic minority groups In addition those living in deprived areas are the most likely to be diagnosed with COVID 19 and have worse outcomes when hospitalised Because smoking and vaping prevalence is highest among people from disadvantaged groups the impact these behaviours have on SARS CoV 2 infection may be more pronounced in these groups In this study we will use a representative population sample of adults in England to estimate associations between suspected SARS CoV 2 infection and smoking status e cigarette use and NRT use,10.1101/2020.06.29.20142661
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,This can be difficult to achieve in individuals with facial hair and in children It can also inadvertently lead to frequent contact between the hands and the face while adjusting the mask which further increases the risk of transmission The tight seal also leads to the build up of heat and humidity within the mask causing discomfort and difficulty in breathing The duration and cost of manufacturing are longer and higher and during a pandemic shortages of this equipment can result in avoidable exposure to HCWs During a pandemic or health crisis HCWs need to be able to access PPE readily in order to protect themselves patients and their contacts Interpretation of this case and the above studies helps us understand the need to urgently conduct large scale RCTs and incorporate the findings of these trials and studies to revise the existing guidelines regarding the use of RPE by HCWs and possibly increase the usage of readily available surgical masks in favor of N95 masks for preventing COVID 19 transmission Till the availability of any conclusive evidence health care providers in direct contact with COVID 19 cases should continue the use of N95 respirators as advocated by the current guidelines,10.7759/cureus.7621
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,Another concern is the shortage of mask supply in the community Medical masks must be reserved for health care workers Yet to control the infection source rather than to self protect we believe that cloth masks as recommended by the CDC are likely to be adequate especially if everyone wears a mask Cloth masks can be easily manufactured or made at home and reused after washing Authorities also worry about correct techniques for wearing removal and disposal of face masks but these techniques could be learned through public education,10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30918-1
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,This commentary echoes the plea from Greenhalgh to encourage people to wear a disposable surgical mask face mask in the community There is limited clinical evidence that wearing a disposable face mask enhancing hand hygiene practice or social distancing can reduce transmission of respiratory viral infections in the community although there is mechanistic basis for these measures to work For COVID 19 hand hygiene and social distancing are widely recommended while universal use of face masks in the community is not widely recommended especially in some Western countries Some doubted the effectiveness of wearing a face mask in the community Some argued it may foster a false sense of security Some said face masks should be reserved for healthcare workers Inconsistent messages from the experts and policy makers about the rationale for the recommendation has led to confusion in the community I aim to provide further clarification of the evidence and ethics on this issue which can provide grounds alternative and/or supplementary to the precautionary principle applied by Greenhalgh and make a plea to the World Health Organisation WHO and policy makers to reformulate current recommendations with a view to enhancing the practice of wearing a face mask in the community,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002819
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,It has been suggested that face masks should be reserved for healthcare workers the sick and caregivers While this can be a ground for rationing the distribution of face masks to those in greater needs this by no means offers a reasonable basis to ignore the evidence about its benefits in the community setting To start with the authorities should have always kept a sufficient amount of protective gears for the healthcare workers and for everyone in the community in preparation of an outbreak In case of shortage during a pandemic there is no dispute that those in greater needs such as healthcare workers should be given higher priorities of getting face masks However it is also important to protect the public and slow the spread of the infection in the community The proper approach to addressing shortage is to formulate stratified recommendations that take full account of the benefits of using face masks in the community and provide solutions at different scenarios,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002819
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,It is important to develop a rational approach to ensure adequate supply for frontline workers in supply chain crisis scenario At community level use of non medical masks like cloth masks are useful to curtail transmission risk The price disparity between medical masks and N95 respirators question their cost effectiveness at population level In this pandemic medical mask supplies should be reserved for health care workers with encouraging people to use cloth masks while going in public Initiative to educate people on non inferiority of non medical masks at community level with a price check on mask vendors is necessary,10.1007/s12098-020-03316-w
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,Current guidelines by World Health Organization WHO advice against community use of masks due to lack of evidence as well as gross shortage of masks However global use of masks may be the only way of control of spread of infection from asymptomatic carriers Most health care providers agree that wearing a self made mask or even a scarf covering the face and eye glasses is better than not wearing any It is especially necessary in a setting like dermatology outpatients where the number of cases is bigger and chances of cross infection from physician to patient or vice versa are high The outpatient case load can be reduced by limiting appointments to only emergency cases,10.1111/dth.13521
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,Masking should be mandatory for individuals in essential functions health care workers social and family workers the police and the military the service sector construction workers etc and medical masks and gloves or equally safe protection should be provided to them by employers Cloth masks should be used if medical masks are unavailable,
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,Initially the usage of masks among the general public was highly controversial Experts discouraged healthy people from wearing masks due to the scarce supply This equipment was reserved for those in direct contact with infected patients However the rapid rise in the degree of local transmission has caused many countries to allow their citizens to wear non medical cloth masks along with practicing social distancing Evidence based studies reveal that the concomitant use of household non medical face masks as well as using a proper handwashing regimen reduces the probability of local transmission thereby decreasing the death toll It should be noted that according to the World Health Organization WHO guidelines medical masks and respirators should only be reserved for healthcare workers,10.7759/cureus.8248
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,Mask use is more effective in protecting others from spread of viral pathogens than protecting the wearer from infection Ideal fabrics for Do It Yourself masks include denim canvas and paper towels with scarves as a last resort Layering adds potential protection but also can decrease ability to breathe easily In general surgical masks and N95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders In healthcare settings N95 masks should be reserved for high risk aerosolizing procedures such as intubation and endotracheal suction and high risk healthcare workers including those with a history of asthma The use of expired N95 masks may be acceptable in some circumstances Fit testing and seal check is recommended for all N95 mask use expired or not The straps and bridge of the nose are usually the first areas to break down and should be visually inspected before use To preserve masks and maximize usage longer usage is preferred over re usage A face shield used over a mask is preferred and may help extend the life of the mask,10.1016/j.pedhc.2020.07.004
0,the public should buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks,There had been evidence of airborne transmission of SARS as well therefore respirators were recommended for SARS during 2002 03 outbreak In Canada initially masks were recommended but this recommendation was later changed to respirators due to the deaths of health workers A recent study demonstrated the presence of coronavirus in anal swabs from infected patients and possibility of transmission through faecal oral route Transmission dynamics for COVID 19 are still unclear and pharmaceutical control measures are not yet available therefore N95 or higher respirators should be offered to health workers who are working at the frontline Health workers and other first responders in high coronavirus transmission areas should use respirators during routine care of coronavirus cases Health workers and first responders in low risk countries should use a respirator when encountering a suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus If respirators are not available then masks should be used,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103567
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,Thus this study shows that COVID 19 can be effectively controlled in Nigeria using face masks of moderate efficacy eg face masks with 50% efficacy if the compliance in their usage is high enough in the extremely high range of 80% to 95% These face mask compliance figures of 80% to 95% are certainly not realistically attainable in Nigeria or anywhere else in the world Hence the control strategy based on the use of face masks with moderate efficacy in the public should be complemented with other non pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and community lockdown to achieve realistic effective control of the pandemic in Nigeria,10.1101/2020.05.22.20110387
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,Evidence from the 2003 SARS epidemic and 2009 H1N1 pandemic shows that face masks can be an effective non pharmaceutical intervention in minimizing the spread of airborne viruses Recent studies have shown that using face masks is correlated to an individual s age and gender where females and older adults are more likely to wear a mask than males or youths There are only a few studies quantifying the impact of using face masks to slow the spread of an epidemic at the population level and even fewer studies that model their impact in a population where the use of face masks depends upon the age and gender of the population We use a state of the art agent based simulation to model the use of face masks and quantify their impact on three levels of an influenza epidemic and compare different mitigation scenarios,10.1007/978-3-642-39149-1_8
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,Face masks may offer some degree of protection and containment; however studies of mask effectiveness are relatively limited While no studies to date have examined the effectiveness against transmission of SARS CoV 2 the mechanisms of transmission via droplet and direct contact are likely highly similar to better characterized viruses A cluster randomized household study examined the effectiveness of surgical and P2 N95 masks in preventing transmission of influenza like illness finding a significant reduction associated with compliant mask use although most participants failed to adhere to mask use sufficiently to see a benefit Cowling showed that mask use and handwashing implemented within 36 hours of a case diagnosis could significantly reduce secondary household influenza cases Mathematical models have also suggested that the number of influenza A cases can be reduced significantly even if just a small proportion of the population wear masks A systematic review on physical interventions to limit transmission of respiratory viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome concluded that face mask use was effective,10.1101/2020.04.04.20052696
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,In this study we look at the efficacy of face masks as a mitigation measure against SARS CoV 2 A mathematical model was used to determine the impact and cost effectiveness of face masks to reduce susceptibility or as a source control and prevention of transmission Our results show that when a proper mask is used correctly there is reduction in exposure and a delay in the spread of the virus within the community It also flattens the curve and provides time to expand the healthcare capacity We caution here that these results are achievable when a proper mask is used efficiently Any mask is only as efficient as the way it is used fitted worn and discarded The reason it can cause more spreading of the virus is because people do not fit their masks properly and continue touching the outer contaminated surface to adjust it without hand washing or sanitizing thereafter Therefore our results are obtainable with continued public adherence to correct use of proper face masks,10.1101/2020.06.11.20128272
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,Under simulated epidemics the effectiveness of face masks in altering the epidemiologic outcomes of peak hospitalization and total deaths is a highly nonlinear function of both mask efficacy and coverage in the population with the product of mask efficacy and coverage a good one dimensional surrogate for the effect,10.1101/2020.04.06.20055624
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,Though the ultimate impact for face mask orders on transmission also depends on the unknown relative effectiveness in breaking transmission of face masks and staying home,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111302
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,In this study we have shown that face mask use in the general population can have a beneficial impact in reducing the total number of cases and deaths and that this impact naturally increases with mask effectiveness The benefits of mask deployment are apparent even with low effectiveness and limited resources In such cases though mask deployment may not have a large impact on total cases and deaths indirect benefits for outbreak management are achieved by delaying the epidemic peak Importantly however the overall impact of mask deployment hinges on appropriate distribution strategies We consistently observed that the random distribution of masks throughout the general population is a suboptimal strategy In contrast prioritizing the elderly population and retaining a supply of masks for identified infectious cases generally leads to a larger reduction in total infections and deaths than a naÃ¯ve allocation of resources While there remains much uncertainty around the true effectiveness of face masks especially when factoring in differences in mask types levels of adherence and patterns of human behavior there is evidence to suggest that masks can provide a measure of protection and containment for respiratory viruses likely a greater degree of the latter than the former,10.1101/2020.04.04.20052696
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,In addition this study found that the LMC face mask may have equal filtering capacity to internationally sold conventional surgical and medical masks A recent study on homemade face masks demonstrated that conventional surgical and medical masks were three times more effective in reducing microorganism transmission compared to homemade masks The current study suggests that the LMC face mask may be equal in effectiveness to preventing airborne infections when compared to conventional masks,10.4081/mrm.2020.664
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,While mask use can help to mitigate transmission the supply and demand model suggests that panic buying at the very early phase of an epidemic can be detrimental and that managing demand in the early stages of the outbreak could be beneficial In Taiwan the government implemented such a resource management strategy in early February 2020 limiting the number of masks each person can buy per week with their National Health Insurance cards As human behavior and compliance are a significant component of how effective mask use is it is essential that public health recommendations concerning face masks in the general population occur in tandem with clear education on proper use and application such that limited resources are used as effectively as possible,10.1101/2020.04.04.20052696
1,you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask,Surgical masks reduced P aeruginosa infected aerosols produced by coughing by over 80% in cystic fibrosis patients in while surgical masks reduced CFU count by more than 90% in a similar study N95 masks were more effective in both studies Homemade teacloth masks had an inward efficiency between 58 and 77% over 3 hours of wear in while inward efficiency ranged 72 85% and 98 99% for surgical and N95 equivalent masks Outward efficiency was marginal for teacloth masks and about 50 70% for medical masks Surgical masks worn by tuberculosis patients also reduced the infectiousness of hospital ward air in and Leung very recently observed surgical masks to decrease infectious aerosol produced by individuals with seasonal coronaviruses Manikin studies seem to recommend masks as especially valuable under coughing conditions for both source control and prevention,10.1101/2020.04.06.20055624
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,Number of Newly Infected Individuals We look at the final number of new infected individuals in both transportation systems as shown per infected individual per protection level As shown in the graph the bus transportation system mostly generates more infections than the train This may be due to the greater capacity of the said transportation system The greater the occupied capacity the greater the number of infected individuals since there are a greater the number of susceptible individuals This is true for all social distancing and interaction scenarios,10.1101/2020.06.09.20126334
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,As expected the requested minimum ventilation rate increases proportionally with the length of exposure time Increasing social distance ie reducing the occupancy ratio can significantly reduce the required ventilation rate For instance for office the required ventilation rate can be reduced by more than four fifth when the occupancy ratio reduced to 25% at the first 30 minute exposure For public bus with the highest infection risk the required ventilation rate can be reduced by 40% Under the scenarios of 25 50% occupancy ratio or 50% occupancy ratio with a higher Ez of 14 the required ventilation rate for office was even below the conventional minimum fresh air requirement in the standard For all transportations and other public buildings the standard required minimum fresh air flow rate is not enough to achieve the set risk mitigation goal,10.1016/j.scs.2020.102390
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,The spring and summer seasonal amplitude of pulmonary TB over period 2009 2013 were significantly lower than that over 2004 2008 The seasonal variation reduced along with the number of pulmonary TB cases The decrease of TB cases might be one of the reasons of the change of seasonal variation The other reason might be the variation of the influencing factors driving the seasonality of TB such as the increasing of ground public transport The first section of the Wuhan subway system was opened on December 12 2012 and more and more subways begin work now The crowding and close environmental of subway cars would provide enough chance to the TB transmission,10.1371/journal.pone.0108369
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,We also observed the behavior of transmission between these two systems on a fixed scenario with fixed parameter values Given the larger capacity of bus compared to a train wagon the bus scenario generated more infections during the simulation However the infections inside the train was faster in reaching its peak number of infections due to a smaller dimension It is easier to encounter an infected individual in a smaller transportation system A decrease in the crowd density on larger vehicles or decrease in travel time inside smaller transportation systems may be looked upon by decision makers to address the epidemic,10.1101/2020.06.09.20126334
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,The coronavirus is spread through coughing or sneezing or by touching an infected person Commuters are particularly at risk since they travel with large crowds in enclosed spaces and subway handrails may spread the virus through contact transmission There is also a risk of the virus adhering to the car doors and elevator buttons People cannot avoid the germs that touch their hands and masks which puts them under substantial psychological and physiological pressure,10.4081/jphr.2020.1770
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,shows that as the bus gets crowded or overcrowded the greater the number of individuals are being infected Number of new infected is least up to 100% crowd density when social distancing is practiced and interaction is not allowed Other than this case crowd density should be less than 10% to prevent spread of infection Likewise number of newly infected is greatest when there is interaction and social distancing is not practiced In general as the crowd density increases number of new infected increases Also overcrowding will result in a large number of infection in the whole vehicle as long as there is an infectious individual These observations are true for all cases,10.1101/2020.06.09.20126334
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,The highly pathogenic strains of the influenza A H5N1 virus have become the most feared candidate for a potential pandemic strain Concern about the likely occurrence of an influenza pandemic in the near future is increasing Aihara and Yasuda investigated the effect of train commute on the spread of pandemic influenza infection in Japan The effect of a crowded train car was estimated to increase the eventual number of people infected by a factor of 2 3 and to cause the peak of the epidemic curve to arise 30 days earlier assuming that the probability that a susceptible person who got on a crowded train car was infected This probability was assumed to be in 800000 when one infected person was placed at the center of the city,10.1007/bf02898153
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,The enclosed and crowded indoor environments in long route coach buses usually experience high infection risk of respiratory diseases due to droplet transmissions In this study as a novelty we built a numerical model according to a real case to investigate the influence of ventilation and evaporation of exhaled droplets on their transport We employed five air supply directions two kinds of relative humidities and initial droplet sizes We summarized the number of droplets droplet nuclei suspending in different zones and depositing on the body surface of each passenger to show the temporal and spatial characteristics of droplet distributions,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122609
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,The World Health Organization WHO declared on March 11  2020 that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic Its worldwide spread in 2020 has affected public transportation systems of different countries Growing concerns of infection due to interaction of infected individuals with the general population have driven changes in mobility and public transportation Many countries including countries in Asia such as China India Malaysia and Philippines imposed restrictions or suspension on their public transportation to prevent the spread of the disease In the Philippines all kinds of public transportation including railway systems have been suspended in Luzon since March 17 2020 in connection with the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine,10.1101/2020.06.09.20126334
1,being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection,Due to high occupation density and enclosed spaces public transport provides prime conditions for person to person transmission presumably much higher than other transport modes This danger is exacerbated by the coronavirus ability to remain active on surfaces like plastics and metals for a period of several hours Rail transport for instance took a key role in accelerating the spread of influenza to new areas in the 1918 AH1N1 pandemic While studies have addressed air travel intercity bus and rail few studies have incorporated the effect of proximity in urban public transport Ohkusa and Sugawara and Yasuda presented different modelling approaches for a hypothetical spread of influenza which included the effect of mass transportation in the metropolitan area of Tokyo,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100166
0,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,Transmission of ILIs on board these aircraft clustered closely with a passenger who was symptomatic during the flight or may have been in contact with an infectious passenger for more than 15 minutes during the flight This finding is similar to transmission of pandemic H1N1 2009 noted on a long-haul flight to New Zealand in 2009 Recent studies on the transmission of pandemic H1N1 2009 in ferrets demonstrated preference for aerosol and droplet transmission of the virus A similar study investigating the disease in a tour group in China indicated droplet transmission from coughing or talking with the index case-patient as being the main mode of transmission The cabin in the A380-800 allows for a 10% wider seat in economy class than does the 747-400 and modern ventilation systems in aircraft circulate air around bands of seat rows rather than the through length of the aircraft However neither of these measures are enough to prevent droplet transmission from either talking 1 meter or spread of smaller aerosol droplets,10.3201/eid1707.101135
0,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,A total of 16 COVID 19 patients were diagnosed among all passengers the overall attack rate was 4% The attack rate among passengers who had departed from Wuhan was significantly higher than that among those who had departed from other places One passenger without an epidemiological history of exposure before boarding developed COVID 19 During the flight he was seated near four infected passengers from Wuhan for approximately an hour and did not wear his facemask correctly during the flight CONCLUSIONS COVID 19 transmission may have occurred during the flight However the majority of the cases in the flight associated outbreak could not be attributed to transmission on the flight but were associated with exposure to the virus in Wuhan or to infected members in a single tour group,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101816
0,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,SARS CoV 2 transmission on aircraft were similar to those without in flight history as previously reported Notably the symptoms of COVID 19 patients infected in this flight were relatively mild outcomes were inclined to be better and the risk to passengers was higher compared with transmission of SARS on aircraft,10.1101/2020.03.28.20040097
1,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,Infection during flights has been found to have a significant probability Even though aircraft are equipped with High Efficiency Particulate Air HEPA filters which reduce the risk of transmission through the air circulation system several studies have demonstrated that infection rates can be as high as 4% in a 9 hours flight and that the risk does not depend on the relative seating of contagious passengers and passengers infected in flight Mangili and Gendreau already discussed the need for additional work on in flight transmissions but insufficient data have been made available in the meanwhile to allow a more robust conclusion,10.3390/ijerph17103356
0,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,In conclusion a flight related outbreak of COVID 19 was investigated The temporal spatial and exposure evidence suggests that SARS CoV 2 transmission may have occurred during the flight However the majority of 16 cases in the outbreak were not attributed to transmission on the flight Exposure to the virus in Wuhan or by infected members within the same tour group account for most cases in the outbreak Our investigation suggests that it is important to take measures such as wearing a mask temperature screening and quarantine of close contacts to reduce the transmission of SARS CoV 2 before during and after flights,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101816
0,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,There are several publications that suggest transmission of SARS CoV 2 on aircraft One reported on 11 patients who were diagnosed after having flown together in the same flight with no passenger that could later be identified as the source of infection Another reported a single case most likely acquired during a flight But a flight with an index patient who had a dry cough when onboard did not appear to spread infection to any of the approximately 350 passengers An IATA document has reported a number of flights with passengers with SARS CoV 2 infection who apparently infected no other passengers but also one UK to Vietnam flight with up to 14 people infected Also based on an IATA survey of four airlines it was reported that: There was one possible secondary passenger case identified in the total along with just two crew cases thought to be the result of possible in flight transmission,10.1101/2020.06.10.20127977
0,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,Previous studies suggest that the basic reproductive number of COVID 19 ranges between 1 and 6 COVID 19 seems to be more transmissible than SARS and MERS However in the present flight outbreak of COVID 19 the relative low number of the secondary cases that occurred due to transmission during the flight may be attributed to the wearing of masks which have been shown to be effective in blocking the transmission of respiratory diseases at mass gatherings The low rate of transmission during the flight may also be attributed to the design of and equipment in the aircraft The air recirculation system with the highly efficient particulate filter equipment and laminar nature of airflow may have effectively prevented or restricted the transmission of the virus In addition after landing all passengers were sent to designated places for medical isolation and observation The strict management of all passengers further contributed to avoiding a larger travel associated outbreak of COVID 19,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101816
1,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,Here we report an in flight transmission cluster of COVID 19 and describe the clinical characteristics of these patients Methods After a flight laboratory confirmed COVID 19 was reported in 12 patients Ten patients were admitted to the designated hospital Data were collected from 25th January to 28th February 2020 Clinical information was retrospectively collected Results All patients are passengers without flight attendants The median age was 33 years and 70% were females None was admitted to intensive care unit and no patients succumbed through 28th February The median incubation period was 3 days and from illness onset to hospital admission was 2 days The most common symptom was fever Two patients were asymptomatic and negative for chest CT scan throughout the disease course On admission initial RT PCR were positive in 9 patients however initial chest CT were positive in only half patients The median lung total severity score of chest CT was 6 Notably Crazy Paving pattern pleural effusion and ground glass nodules were also seen Conclusion It is potential for COVID 19 transmission by airplane but the symptoms are mild Passengers and attendants must be protected during the flight,10.1101/2020.03.28.20040097
0,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,Air travel for leisure and business purposes has risen markedly in recent years due to economic growth and increased globalization Although infrequently reported and difficult to assess accurately respiratory agents may be easily transmitted to passengers during air travel owing to limited ventilation high occupant density and a long exposure time Multiple outbreaks of respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS measles tuberculosis and influenza associated with air travel have been reported Recent studies suggest that SARS CoV 2 may be more transmissible than severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS coronavirus However there have not yet been any reports of probable transmission of SARS CoV 2 during air travel,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101816
0,since a planes cabin keeps circulating air i will get sick if another passenger is sick,From 1992 to 1994 seven different flights that carried tuberculosis infected passengers were investigated Index patients on all seven flights were highly infectious symptomatic sputum smear positive for acid fast bacilli and evidence of cavitary disease on chest radiograph There was strong evidence of tuberculosis transmission on three flights Infection was transmitted from one flight attendant to two other crew members on one flight whereas transmission from the index case to fellow passengers and flight crew was documented in another two flights Risk of transmission was associated with proximity to the index cases sitting in same section of plane and a long duration of flight more than 12 hours There was no evidence of transmission on the other four flights despite highly infectious passengers on board suggesting that although in flight transmission is possible the risk is still very low,10.1016/j.idc.2004.10.001
